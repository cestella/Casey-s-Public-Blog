Purpose
=======
I am interested in data mining and large scale data analysis.
Nothing makes me happier than math, statistics, coding and distributed computing. 
I mercilessly chase hard problems.

Professional Experience
=======================

##Hortonworks, San Jose CA

##Systems Architect - November 2012 to Present
I am a Systems Architect in the consulting services organization at Hortonworks.  I provide
mentorship and guidance in operationalizing Hadoop and its ecosystem to solve business problems
for our clients.  I work with our clients to reduce risk and time to market by providing expertise 
in big data.

* Provide proof-of-concepts to reduce engineering churn
* Give extensive presentations about the Hadoop ecosystem, best practices, data architecture in Hadoop
* Provide mentorship and guidance to other architects to help them become independent
* Provide review and feedback for existing physical architecture, data architecture and individual code
* Debug and solve issues with Hadoop as on-the-ground subject matter expert.  This could include everything from patching components to post-mortem analysis of errors.

##Explorys, Cleveland OH 

##"Big Data" Architect - January 2011 to November 2012
I was a "big data" architect and, prior to that, a senior software engineer on the platform team at Explorys. 
The team was responsible for the creation, care and maintenance of the high performance indexing infrastructure.
My job required a deep understanding of the Hadoop ecosystem.  I designed the next generation data 
architecture for the unstructured data at Explorys as well as writing, debugging, and analyzing the 
performance of many map reduce jobs to realize that architecture.  

* Devised and lead the implementation of the next generation architecture for more efficient data ingestion and processing.
* Proficiency with mentoring and on-boarding new engineers who are not proficient in Hadoop and getting them up to speed quickly.
* Experience with being a technical lead of a team of engineers.
* Proficiency with modern natural language processing and general machine learning techniques and approaches
* Extensive experience with Hadoop and HBase, including multiple public presentations about these technologies.
* Experience with hands on data analysis and performing under pressure.
* Designed and wrote a layer on top of MapReduce to make the task of writing MapReduce jobs easier and more safe for Junior Engineers.
* Contributed much of the code in our [open source project](http://github.com/ExplorysMedical/Apothecary).

## Game Communication, Mayfield Heights OH

## Senior Engineer - November 2009 to January 2011

Designed, implemented and integrated into legacy code a scalable network
infrastructure layer for an instant message and VOIP network

* Created a software routing layer and implemented an ordered, reliable
  protocol on top of the raw network layer
* Integrated Cassandra as a distributed persistent metadata store to
  provide metadata resolution for network entities on the network
* Created low-level network libraries in C++ and C# to send messages
  across the network
* Spearheaded institution of pair-programming and semi-agile practices

## ION Geophysical, Houston TX

## Research Geophysicist - October 2008 to November 2009

Member of the time processing R&D team, tasked to design,
prototype and implement production-ready algorithms to 
use applied math and signal processing to reduce noise 
in seismic data.  This was a telecommuting position from
Cleveland, OH.

* Implemented multithreaded C++ applied linear algebra library consisting of efficient STL-compliant data structures and algorithms to assist in signal processing
* Assisted in the design and implementation of an internal flow-based map-reduce system for doing distributed scientific computation
* Used Tokyo Cabinet to provide an on-disk index of seismic metadata in an efficient way
* Implemented a multidimensional least squares adaptive filter that decreased wall-clock time for our most common seismic task by an order of magnitude
* Developed a fixed-precision algorithm in C for the embedded PowerPC 405 platform which uses first-order statistics to differentiate noise from initial signal in an accurate, efficient and robust way
* Spearheaded institution of pair-programming and semi-agile practices in a geographically dispersed environment

## Oracle, Cleveland OH

## Senior Member of Technical Staff - October 2005 to October 2008

Member of the Oracle Enterprise Repository team.  We 
provided an enterprise J2EE application to organize 
and manage assets and their metadata. 

* Worked as part of a geographically distributed team using agile practices
* Designed and implemented an enterprise build system around Maven, porting an existing heterogeneous build system from Ant and shell scripts to Maven
* Implemented multiple performance and scalability improvements, resulting in substantial benefits deriving from better caching strategies and algorithms with more favorable CPU/Memory complexity characteristics.
* Managed summer interns
