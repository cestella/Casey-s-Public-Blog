Professional Experience
=======================

##Explorys, Cleveland OH 

##Senior Engineer - January 2011 to Present

Design and implement software to assist in the gathering, preprocessing
and analysis of data from hospitals

* Proficiency with modern natural language processing and general 
 machine learning techniques and approaches
* Experience with Hadoop and HBase

## Game Communication, Mayfield Heights OH

## Senior Engineer - November 2009 to January 2011

Designed, implemented and integrated into legacy code a scalable network
infrastructure layer for an instant message and VOIP network

* Created a software routing layer and implemented an ordered, reliable
  protocol on top of the raw network layer
* Integrated Cassandra as a distributed persistent metadata store to
  provide metadata resolution for network entities on the network
* Created low-level network libraries in C++ and C# to send messages
  across the network
* Spearheaded institution of pair-programming and semi-agile practices

## ION Geophysical, Houston TX

## Research Geophysicist - October 2008 to November 2009

Member of the time processing R&D team, tasked to design,
prototype and implement production-ready algorithms to 
use applied math and signal processing to reduce noise 
in seismic data.  This was a telecommuting position from
Cleveland, OH.

* Implemented multithreaded C++ applied linear algebra library consisting of efficient STL-compliant data structures and algorithms to assist in signal processing
* Assisted in the design and implementation of an internal flow-based map-reduce system for doing distributed scientific computation
* Used Tokyo Cabinet to provide an on-disk index of seismic metadata in an efficient way
* Implemented a multidimensional least squares adaptive filter that decreased wall-clock time for our most common seismic task by an order of magnitude
* Developed a fixed-precision algorithm in C for the embedded PowerPC 405 platform which uses first-order statistics to differentiate noise from initial signal in an accurate, efficient and robust way
* Spearheaded institution of pair-programming and semi-agile practices in a geographically dispersed environment

## Oracle, Cleveland OH

## Senior Member of Technical Staff - October 2005 to October 2008

Member of the Oracle Enterprise Repository team.  We 
provided an enterprise J2EE application to organize 
and manage assets and their metadata. 

* Worked as part of a geographically distributed team using agile practices
* Designed and implemented an enterprise build system around Maven, porting an existing heterogeneous build system from Ant and shell scripts to Maven
* Implemented multiple performance and scalability improvements, resulting in substantial benefits deriving from better caching strategies and algorithms with more favorable CPU/Memory complexity characteristics.
* Managed summer interns
