About Me
========
I am a software engineer deeply interested in data mining and large scale data analysis. 
Nothing makes me happier than math, stats, coding and distributed computing. 
I mercilessly chase hard problems.

I spent my formative years in [rural Louisiana](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&q=Bastrop,+LA&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Bastrop,+Morehouse,+Louisiana&gl=us&ll=32.754942,-91.870422&spn=1.436707,2.765808&t=h&z=9).
Every time I think I've adjusted to the weather and culture, I find that I really don't
understand some fundamental thing about my adopted home.  I live here with my [wife](http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=L_GOLD33), my son and my soon-to-be daughter.
I dig being a father and husband very much.

My educational emphasis and current interests are in theoretical Computer Science and Mathematics.
I received my MS in Mathematics from Texas A&M in 2005. Since then, I've constructed
a living around software engineering.  This path has kept me generally restricted to
[first-world problems](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems), so I am forced to
conclude that I'm doing something right.

About This Site
===============

This site's HTML and infrastructure is lovingly generated and tended by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
with only nominal direction from me.
Much of the formatting and CSS is based around a fork of [Mark Reid](http://mark.reid.name/)'s site.
I'd also like to take a moment to thank Krista Lipps for the cartoon on the home page.  Once she gets
a site up, she'll get a link.
