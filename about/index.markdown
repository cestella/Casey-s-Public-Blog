About Me
========

I write software in Cleveland, OH despite having my formative years in rural Louisiana.
Every time I think I've adjusted to the weather and culture, I find that I really don't
get my adopted home.  I live here with my [wife](http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=L_GOLD33)
and son. I dig being a father and husband very much.

My educational emphasis and current interests are in theoretical Computer Science and Mathematics.
I received my MS in Mathematics from Texas A&M in 2005. Since then, I've constructed
a living around software engineering.  This path has kept me generally restricted to
first-world problems, so I can only assume that I'm doing something right.

About This Site
===============

This site's HTML is lovingly created by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Much of the formatting and
CSS was based around a fork of [Mark Reid](http://mark.reid.name/)'s site.  I'd also like to
take a moment to thank Krista Lipps for the cartoon on the home page.  Once she gets a site up,
she'll get a link.
