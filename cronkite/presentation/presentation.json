AND ITS FOUNDER, PALMER LUCKEY\nMay 21, 2014 (Rockville, MD) -- ZeniMax Media Inc. and its subsidiary, id Software LLC, filed suit today against Oculus VR, Inc. and its founder, Palmer Luckey, for illegally misappropriating ZeniMax trade secrets relating to virtual reality technology, and infringing ZeniMax copyrights and trademarks. ZeniMax is also asserting claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition against the defendants. The suit was filed in federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.\nThe suit arises from the defendants' unlawful exploitation of intellectual property, including trade secrets, copyrighted computer code, and technical know-how relating to virtual reality technology that was developed by ZeniMax after years of research and investment. ZeniMax provided this valuable intellectual property to defendants under a binding Non-Disclosure Agreement that specifies such intellectual property is owned exclusively by ZeniMax and cannot be used, disclosed, or transferred to third parties without ZeniMax's approval. ZeniMax's intellectual property has provided the fundamental technology driving the Oculus Rift since its inception. Nevertheless, the defendants refused all requests from ZeniMax for reasonable compensation and continue to use ZeniMax's intellectual property without authorization.\nAll efforts by ZeniMax to resolve this matter amicably have been unsuccessful. Oculus has recently issued a public statement remarkably claiming that \"ZeniMax has never contributed IP or technology to Oculus.\" Meanwhile, Luckey has held himself out to the public as the visionary developer of virtual reality technology, when in fact the key technology Luckey used to establish Oculus was developed by ZeniMax.\n\"Intellectual property forms the foundation of our business,\" said Robert Altman, Chairman & CEO of ZeniMax. \"We cannot ignore the unlawful exploitation of intellectual property that we develop and own, nor will we allow misappropriation and infringement to go unaddressed.\"\n\"ZeniMax and id Software take their intellectual property rights seriously,\" said P. Anthony Sammi, a Partner of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP which represents ZeniMax and id in this matter. \"We now look to the federal courts and will pursue all appropriate measures available under the law to rectify defendants' egregious conduct,\" he added.\n 2014 ZENIMAX MEDIA INC.

            "content": "The Operating System is the Control Plane\nSearch\nPublications\nOverview\nArrakis is a new operating system that is designed around recent application and hardware trends: Applications are becoming so complex that they are miniature operating systems in their own right and are hampered by the existing OS protection model. For example, a web browser needs to protect itself against untrusted scripts and native code extensions, but does not have the rights to setup protection domains within its own application. On the hardware side, virtualization technologies and I/O devices have become increasingly sophisticated and take on more and more functions traditionally carried out by the operating system. For example, modern NICs can demultiplex incoming packets directly into the target application.\nIn Arrakis, we ask the question whether we can remove the OS entirely from normal application execution. The OS only sets up the execution environment and interacts with an application in rare cases where resources need to be reallocated or name conflicts need to be resolved. The application gets the full power of the unmediated hardware, through an application-specific library linked into the application address space. This allows for unprecedented OS customizability, reliability and performance. Interesting research questions arise in this scenario: How do we provide the same lightweight sharing between applications that traditional operating systems supply? How do we provide a single file system? What happens when resources are frequently reallocated? How hard is it to port existing operating systems to a library OS?\nRecent Posts\n",

This is the story of the greatest bug I never fixed.\nIn an earlier life I wrote addons for World of Warcraft . Aside from being addicted to the game at the time, it was a mindblowing experience for someone obsessed with plugin architectures and the evolution of public APIs. It was also a great excuse to learn Lua , which is a fun language.\nOne of the better addons a friend and I built during that period was FriendNet. FriendNet helped to deal with the greatest challenge in the game: Finding people to play with who aren't dicks. The addon took your in-game friend list and shared it with all your friends. In return, they shared their friends with you. As a result the number of people you could trust weren't dicks increased.\nBecause any form of network communication was forbidden by the addon API, we had to come up with a hack to distribute those friend lists. What we did was serialize those lists into in-game chat messages and whisper them to the receiving player's avatar.\nYes, years before your Mom discovered Facebook we were tunnelling social graphs over the chat channels of a virtual world. We should have gotten funding.\nAnyway, FriendNet did have some quality issues. P2P applications are hard to get right, and you can't just make people upgrade every time you release a bugfix. So we had all those different versions talking with each other, resulting in a lot of emergent behaviour and hard to reproduce bugs.\nOne bug was especially hard to pin down: Once every few days FriendNet would encounter a corrupt message, resulting in parts of the addon GUI to be messed up. We received enough bug reports to believe that the issue was real, but we could never reproduce the bug no matter how hard we tried. It was the bug from hell. Eventually we gave up, blamed it on a buggy API and moved on.\nThe solution came to me years after I stopped playing the game. When I realized what had gone wrong, the light almost blinded me.\nYou know, your character can get drunk in World of Warcraft . After drinking enough virtual booze, your screen will start to blur and your character will no longer move in straight lines. Also when you type something into the chat like\nPenelope says: I'm so wasted\nIt will come out like this:\nPenelope says: I'm sho washted ...hic!\nBecause FriendNet serialized all of its communication into chat messages, it sent corrupted data whenever the broadcasting player was drunk.\nFriendNet has long since disappeared from the addon sites you could once download it from. I doubt it would even boot up in a current version of the game. But even though I never got to fix that bug, I still remember it with fond amusement.\nHenning Koch @triskweline Apr 28, 2010\nCheck out our new e-book:\n",

            "content": "Leave a reply\nGo obtains much of its compilation speed from the Plan 9 compiler, of which it is a direct descendant. The Plan 9 toolchain deferred much of the work traditionally performed by a compiler to the linking stage and its performance was summarised in section 8 of this paper\nThe new compilers compile quickly, load slowly, and produce medium quality object code.\nBecause of the similar division of labour between Gos compiler and linker, linking is commonly more expensive that compilation. This leads to several problems\nLinking cannot benefit from the incremental compilation, each link pass starts afresheven if only a tiny partof program has changed.\nLinking speed is at least linear (often worse) with the number of packages being linked into the final executable larger programs link slower.\nWhile multiple commands may be linked in parallel, each individual link is single threaded as CPU speeds stall, or go backwards, favouring additional cores, linking gets slower in real terms.\nIt should be noted that while linking is considered slow in terms of the other parts of the Go toolchain, it remains much faster than linking a traditional C or C++ application.\nLinking speed has long been recognised as an issue by the Go developers and during the Go 1.3 development cycle the linker underwent major changes to improve its performance.\nWhat does the Go linker do ?\nTo understand the change, Russ Cox wrote in his proposal at the beginning of the cycle\nThe current linker performs two separable tasks.\nFirst, it translates an input stream of pseudo-instructions into executable code and data blocks, along with a list of relocations.\nSecond, it deletes dead code, merges whats left into a single image, resolves relocations, and generates a few whole-program data structures such as the runtime symbol table.\nIn a nutshell, the change has moved the first task of the linker, the pseudo instruction translation, from the linker into the compiler.\nWhat are pseudo instructions\nPrior to Go 1.3, the output of the compiler, the .a files in your $GOPATH/pkg directory was not directly executable machine code. Instead it was, as Russ describes, a stream of pseudo instructions, which, while not machine independent, it was also not directly executable.\nDuring the linking phase, the linker itself was responsible for turning this pseudo instruction stream into real machine code. Dealing with pseudo instructions during the compilation phase makes the compiler simpler to write.\nAn example of a pseudo instructions are the unifiedMOV instruction available to the compiler and assembler\nMOV R0, R1          // move the contents of R0 into R1 MOV $80000001, R0   // move the the constant 80000001  into R0 MOV R0, 0           // move the value into R0 into address 0\nOn a processor like ARM, when translated to machine code this becomes three separate operations. The first MOV R0, R1 is a simple move from one register to another and the final opcode is MOV.\nThe second form stores the large constant, 80000001 into R0. ARM processors cannot encode such a large constant directly into the instruction so the linker would store the constant at the end of the function and replace the MOV with a load from an address relative to the program counter into a scratch register (R11 is reserved for the linker) then move the value from R11 to R0.\nThe final form also needs help fromthe linker as ARM processors cannot use a constant as anaddress to store a value. The linker will arrange to load 0 into R11 then store the contents with an instruction like MOV R0, (R11)\nThe work required for X86 is similar, although the specific restrictions differ.\nThe results\nTo evaluate the performance improvements of the change to the linker Im going to compare building and linking two programs, the venerable godoc and the jujud server binary which depends on almost every line of code in the Juju repo.\nIn preparation I checked out copies of Go 1.2 and Go 1.3beta1 (this data was collected some time ago, but the changes in 1.3beta2 are unrelated to the linker).\ngodoc\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m3.239s user    0m3.307s sys     0m0.595s\nThe time to compile and link godoc from scratch on this machine with Go 1.2.1 was 3.2 seconds. Lets look at the time just to compile the main package and link godoc\n% touch ~/src/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc/play.go % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m1.578s user    0m1.434s sys     0m0.146s\nWith most of the compilation avoided, the total time drops to 1.5 seconds. Lets look at how the linker change in Go 1.3 affects the results.\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m3.193s user    0m3.441s sys     0m0.530s\nUnder Go 1.3beta1 the time to compile and link from scratch is roughly the same as Go 1.2.1. There is perhaps a hint that more work is being done in parallel. Lets compare the results from an incremental compilation.\n% touch ~/src/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc/play.go % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m0.996s user    0m0.881s sys     0m0.118s\nUnder Go 1.3beta1 the time to compile godocs main package and link has dropped from 1.5 seconds to just under a second. A saving of half a second, or 30% compared to the performance of Go 1.2.1.\njujud\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install  launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m8.247s user    0m18.110s sys     0m3.861s\nTime to compile and link jujud from scratch, roughly 220 packages at this time, was 8.2 seconds using Go 1.2.1. Lets look at the incremental performance.\n% touch ~/src/launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud/main.go % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m3.139s user    0m2.831s sys     0m0.305s\nWhich shows the time to recompile the main package and link the executable is 3.2 seconds. You can also see that the process is almost entirely single threaded as the sum of user and sys is equal to the wall clock time, real.\nLets turn to Go 1.3beta1\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m8.107s user    0m20.533s sys     0m3.574s\nThe full rebuild times are comparable to the Go 1.2.1 results, possibly a hair faster. The real improvements show themselves in the incremental compilation scenario.\n% touch ~/src/launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud/main.go % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m2.219s user    0m1.929s sys     0m0.290s\nUnder Go 1.3beta1 the time to recompile the main package and link has dropped from 3.2 seconds to 2.2 seconds, a saving of one second, again roughly 30%.\nIn conclusion\nIn my tests, the linker improvements coming in Go 1.3 deliver approximately a 30% reduction in link time. Depending on the size of your final executable this could be a small amount, or a significant amount of time.\nOverall the linking change has several important benefits:\nBecause its performed in the compile stage, the result is stored in your $GOPATH/pkg directory. Effectively the instruction selection pass is cached, whereas previously it was recomputed for each binary linked even if they shared many common packages.\nBecause more work is done in the compile stage, it is done in parallel if you have more than one CPU. If you have one CPU the end result is unchanged, the same amount of work is done, just at different phases, although you will benefit from point 1 regardless\nBecause more work is done in the compilation stage, less work is done in the linker, so the files passed to the linker are smaller and the work it has to do, which is effectively a mark, sweep and compact over all the symbols presented, is less.\nIn short, the 1.3 linker rocks.\n",

            "content": "Arcade Story\n2014-05-21\nThis is a story about me and a video game.  Although I have always been and expect I always will be a nerd, the events of this story take place when I was approximately 8-10 years old, meaning I had not yet worn away the extra layer of turbo-nerd that little boys of that inclination tend to have at that age.\nIm not especially proud of this story, but I post it because I think you will find it amusing, and also because it captures a little bit of the essence of the arcade era which has been somewhat lost to time.\nAs the video game industry was on the verge of collapse in 1983/84, one of its most spectacular dying gasps was the laserdisc genre, and by far the most simultaneously beloved and despised game of that genre was Dragons Lair.\nDragons Lair was the story of a sword-wielding adventurer named Dirk the Daring who sets off into a trap-laden castle dungeon to rescue a breathless, blonde, half-naked princess stereotype named Daphne from the titular dragon.\nInside a Dragons Lair cabinet was basically an off-the-shelf Pioneer laserdisc player connected to some custom hardware and a CRT display.\nFor the unfamiliar, what made Dragons Lair unique was its visuals.  Rather than the pixelated spaceships and aliens that everyone had seen before, Dragons Lair was a full-motion cartoon which had been produced by former Disney animator Don Bluth, also famous for animated movies such as The Secret of Nimh.\nAlso unique was its gameplay.  Rather than make continuous movements with the joystick as you would in most arcade games, you watched the cartoon (which was of course always the same) and at specific moments in the scenes you would make a single directional move with the joystick or press the sword button.\nThe move you made was meant to be somewhat informed by what was happening on screen.  If you were surrounded on three sides by evil-looking tentacles, but there was a door open on the right, you were probably meant to go right.  Although you might think attacking the tentacles with the sword button would be appropriate, if that didnt happen to be what the designers had in mind you could say goodbye to one of your lives.\nAlthough the pricing system was highly configurable by the arcade owner, most arcades configured the game to grant you five lives for 50 cents, which was double the traditional 25 cent admission price of most other arcade games at the time.\nSince anyone playing the game for the first time would not already know the moves, and would not be able to infer them in the fraction of a second given to them to make a decision, it was punishingly difficult to play for most people.\nHowever, there was no particular skill involved other than rote memorization  as long as you simply knew what all the moves were and when to make them, you could beat the game every time.\nI was obsessed with Dragons Lair, and its spiritual science-fiction sequel Space Ace.  (A true sequel, Dragons Lair II, is lesser known as it arrived almost exactly as the last remaining arcades were being shuttered.  I only ever saw it in the wild once.)  I was an animation nerd, and a video game nerd, and here were these games right at the intersection.\nLike everyone else, I wasted a lot of my parents quarters playing Dragons Lair and lasting for about 2 minutes before losing all five lives.  Fortunately, the local grocery store had a Dragons Lair cabinet, as well as a couple of other games, so I got many occasions to practice.\nOne day I was sitting in our apartment reading a video game magazine (nerd!), and in the back was a little section of classified ads.  My eye was caught immediately by the words Beat Space Ace and Dragons Lair! For a few bucks, you could send away for this random guys strategy guide, which listed all the moves and when to make them.\nPlease realize there was no residential internet.  We had a computer, but no modem.  There was no just going to Google for an FAQ or walkthrough.  If you didnt know the moves, you just didnt know them, unless you knew someone else who knew them, which of course you didnt.\nI begged my parents.  Weeks later, my strategy guide arrived (a few black and white photocopied sheets of paper stapled together), and I began studying.\nI took notes on the scenes I knew I couldnt beat and made little cheat sheets to take with me to the grocery store.  But it wasnt enough just to know that to get past the room with the swinging paddles and grim reaper you moved up, sword, down, up  you had to know that the first up movement had to be performed at one of a few precise moments.  This still required a bit of trial and error.  (Personally, Id make the move when Dirk was at the bottom of the second of a series of crouches.)\nThen my parents did something unexpected, for which I will always be grateful.\nA local arcade not far from where we lived regularly put old games up for sale.  My dad noticed that they had listed a Space Ace cabinet for $300. To this day I will never forget my shock  my dad bought it and brought it into our tiny apartment.  I had a full-size, real-deal Space Ace arcade cabinet in my childhood bedroom.\nYou have to understand, this sort of thing never happened.  I cannot convey to you how blown away I was by this action.  We werent at immediate risk of starvation or anything, but we were hardly rolling around in piles of excess cash.  We lived in a small apartment in Cupertino.  This sort of superfluous costly purchase was not generally familiar to me.\nI think besides knowing that I loved the game, and it being close-enough to my birthday, my dad thought it might be fun to extract the laserdisc player from the cabinet and do other experiments with it, or connect it to the TV for movies.  But primarily, it was my game, and I was very, very happy.\nAfter some further research, we discovered that the cabinet could be converted to Dragons Lair by simply swapping the laserdisc and a set of ROMs on the motherboard.  So now I had both games at my fingertips, set to free-play, and my strategy guide.  It didnt take long for me to master both games.\nThis is all just my set up for the real story.\nWe were on vacation, as I recall, in Anaheim to go to Disneyland.  I was young, so the details are fuzzy, but this is how I remember it.\nWe were staying in a hotel or motel, and it was either attached to or had a small arcade of its own.  Whenever we went out of town and I saw an arcade, I had to check it out.  I would always beg my parents to let me go in any unfamiliar arcade that we happened across.  Every once in a while, theyd have some weird game that Id never seen before.  Again, there was no internet to tell you what the hottest new video games were  you either happened upon them in an arcade or they might as well have not existed as far as you were concerned.\nThis particular arcade, as I remember it, had an obscure laserdisc game called Thayers Quest which was Dragons Lair-like, but even weirder in that it was controlled by a membrane-style keyboard with commands for things like taking and using specific items found throughout the game.  It was weird and new so I played it until I got thoroughly confused and was starting to run out of quarters.\nBut they also had Dragons Lair.  Knowing that I could beat the game on 50 cents, I wandered over and fired it up.\nI was going through the motions and had progressed to about the middle of the game when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye: a crowd was forming.\nEveryone who has seen Dragons Lair before has seen the beginning of the game.  Dirk runs across the drawbridge, Dirk dodges the falling blocks, he swings across the fire ropes, and he drops on the falling disc platform.  Far fewer have seen the scenes in the middle of the game.  Fewer still have ever seen how it ends.\nSo, even people who had seen the game before were seeing parts of the game theyd never seen.  Word was spreading throughout the arcade  hey, check out this kid playing Dragons Lair.\nI kept on playing, past the lizard king, past the lava men, and finally arrived at the dragons lair with all five lives left.\nTheres several seconds during this scene where Daphne acts like a bimbo (Puh-lease save me!) and you dont have to do anything so I took the opportunity to peek over my shoulder.  There were a substantial number of people standing behind me, watching me play the game.  I dont know exactly how many, but it felt like it must have been somewhere between 8 and 12.  Maybe it wasnt that many and my memory makes it seem more grandiose than it was. But there was a crowd. Enough to attract the attention of others.  (Whats going on over there?)\nWith all of these people watching, I played through the final scene of Dragons Lair, but with a twist.  I didnt make the last move of the game (sword button, which kills the dragon) allowing myself to get incinerated by his fire breath four times.  Not only did this ratchet up the crowd tension to palpable levels, it also increased my score higher than if I had simply beaten the game on the first try.\nThen, with the crowd on tenterhooks  will he win? Does he really know how?  on that last life, I played all the way through to the end. I pressed the sword button then literally turned around and walked away, while the remaining 10-15 (non-interactive) seconds or so of the game played out.  Like the nerd version of the worlds greatest hip-hop act dropping the mic and walking off stage, I just walked away from the game.  Id made the last move.  Nothing left for me here.  Seen this all before.\nWhat an annoying little shit I was. I told you this was a bad story.\nAnyway, no sooner had I stepped away than the crowd pushed in to watch the end sequence of the game, something theyd never seen before, and for all they knew might never see again.\nI dont recall what happened next.  I guess we went to Disneyland.  But my memory of my  I dont know what to call it  performance?  It has always stuck with me.\nMaybe thats what streaming games on Twitch is like for the current generation of kids.  But even knowing that 60 people from around the world are watching you set new records in Call of Duty, I wonder how it stacks up to an actual crowd of people standing directly behind you, as you listen to them whispering to each other about how good this kid is at this game.\nMy video game glory days are probably behind me.  Im still an avid gamer, but Ill never top my crowning Dragons Lair moment.\nIf you are curious about these games, Dragons Lair , Dragons Lair 2 , and Space Ace are available for your iOS device for a few bucks each  a fact that would have shattered my brain into a million tiny pieces back in 1985.\nAs for my personal Space Ace / Dragons Lair cabinet, we sold it shortly after my family moved from California to Oregon so I could have some spending money for some other adventure.  It was hard to part with, but I could tell from how excited the lad who bought it from me was that it went to a good home.\nPost navigation\n",

            "content": "in: personal\nLast year I started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius 1 . While I was reading it, I was struck at how many of the entries were just simple reminders to himself. Don't get mad at people unnecessarily. Remember that you are just one of many. Don't get distracted.\nHe was making the same mistakes over and over, just like I was.\nI thought that writing down what I learned would help it stick. Every time I wanted to add a new tidbit, I would review all of them. It worked much better than I thought it would: it brought issues to the forefront of my mind that I wasn't considering. This was especially helpful when I was in a rush or under stress. Staying calm during a production outage and thinking of the lesson I learned, \"First do no harm\" kept me from making dumb mistakes.\nNow that I'm leaving my job for another opportunity, I decided to collect them and share them so that they might be useful to a wider audience. They follow verbatim. Quotes are from Meditations.\nEngineering\nFailover that you havent tested isnt a failover\nFailover needs testing and monitoring. Backups need testing and monitoring. Include these in your work estimates.\nMake it hard to use wrong\nLibraries and APIs should be easy to use correctly and difficult to use incorrectly.\nDocumentation-driven design\nWrite the documentation first. As you develop, change the documentation before changing the code. Focus on your user: they are the only reason you're doing this.\nFail fast\nFor code thats going to fail, make it fail earlier rather than later. Failing at object construction time is better than while its being used. Failing at compile time better still.\nMake it monitorable\nIf you cant monitor it, how do you know if it even exists? Take the time to get monitoring right.\nMonitor it from a customers perspective\nWrite a program which continually uses your APIs or user interfaces. Make it send emails to everyone when it doesnt work as expected. This can catch subtle errors and monitoring gaps.\nTest your hypotheses\nIf you think you improved performance, you need to have enough monitoring and diagnostics in place to show that you did. Otherwise you didnt improve anything.\nMake it easy to operate\nMaking products easy to operate and fix in production is a necessary and oft-unspoken feature of every product. There should be tools which can fix issues, and these tools should be tested like every other product.\nThink about what to log\nLogging exactly what you need to debug without logging too much is tough. Take some time to get it at least close to correct.\nMake it easy to deploy\nThe goal should be continuous deployment. Everything that gets in the way should be automated.\nDont hide logic\nKeep blocks of code that are related near one another. Moving it to a different place makes it hard to follow.\nBeware expiration times\nExpiration times are the devil. If you see one, it must go on some calendar somewhere. Think before you set an expiration time to five years. What if you set it to a month from now? There are only two valid values for expiration times: finite and on a calendar, or eternity.\nNegative test everything access-control related\nIf you have a signature authentication scheme, you must have tests which test both it accepting signatures and rejecting bad ones. You really should have both unit tests and integration tests for this. The same goes for any access controls.\nOperations\nFirst do no harm\nWhen there is an outage or a problem in production, before you take any steps to correct it, remember not to make the problem worse. Often decisions are made in a panic without fully considering the implications.\nAnalyze theories before acting on them\nIt looks like machines in data center A are corrupting files and machines in data center B are working fine. Solution if you stop your analysis there: stop using data center A. Actual problem: network latency triggering a bug. Analyze your theory more and youll find the real issue.\nLogs need to be searchable\nPut all the logs in some centralized, searchable location. This is critical for debugging production issues fast.\nDon't blame others\nA good doctor isnt surprised when his patients have fevers, or a helmsman when the wind blows against him.\nBugs happen. It's important not to focus on who made the mistake, but why our process failed. Resist people who wish to blame anyone.\nCommunication\nNo one reads long emails\nSo make em concise.\nDistance makes communication hard\nMost problems we had stemmed from some lack of teamwork or communication. Phone calls and frequent messages or emails help. Regular meetings, not so much.\nQuestions not statements\nIf theyve made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you cant do that, then the blame lies with you.\nWhen criticizing anothers work, ask questions rather than make statements. This helps people think through their own work and assess it objectively.\nThe Principle of Charity\nAssume peoples work is well intentioned from the start. No one sets out to do poor work or make (what seems like in hindsight) bad decisions.\nTurn criticism into better products\nBeautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous.\nWhen someone criticizes a product or feature you wrote, see if that criticism can be turned into a bug that can be fixed or an improvement to be added later. Challenge people who criticize often to always include a way to address their criticism. Don't be offended.\nKeep overhead positive\nFor every hour of overhead (meetings, process, travelling), it should at have at least that many hours of saved time. Travelling for two days is worth it if it saves 40 hours worth of work from being needlessly done.\nConvincing others is delicate work\nStart with the most important point only. Once they begin to see that the current situation might not be perfect, introduce more ideas slowly. Act unemotionally. Allow them to think through the idea on their own. Watch 12 Angry Men again.\nVertical visibility is a double-edged sword\nIts great when higher-ups notice your great work. Its bad when theyre informed of every little bug and freak out about it.\nTake unsolicited advice from experience with a grain of salt\nSome people will try and give you unsolicited advice. If their main argument is theyve been doing this for N years which is X years more than you, you should be skeptical.\nHave infodump sessions\nCommunicating is hard. If you want to learn about a system, put it in the infodump spreadsheet and pick a person who knows about it. If enough people vote for it (small, 2 or 3 required), it will be given. No slides. Hands-on.\nDont feign surprise\nLeave other peoples mistakes where they lie.\nYou know when you're surprised when someone did something stupid, or didn't know something? People learn things everyday . Acting surprised is rude. So dont do it .\nWatch where your company is going\nWhere are you headed? Where are they headed? If you're not aligned, it's time to look elsewhere. Ask yourself this every few months.\nInnovation\nThe Red Queen Hypothesis\nIts not enough to merely improve. Everyone is improving constantly, so linearly improving your own offerings merely keeps you in the same place. You must go above and beyond current technology to make any real progress.\nTake time to think\nIf every moment of every day is spent adding features, removing bugs, or coding, its hard to innovate. Make sure theres time in the development cycle for lower intensity work to allow reflection and creative thinking.\nSolve problems, dont just create features\nThe goal of software engineering is to solve peoples problems . Adding features for completeness wastes time. Beware product feature checkboxes and customers who dont want to buy because you dont have feature X even though they dont need it.\nIf you're going to read it too (which I strongly suggest you do, as it's a great book), I highly recommend the Gregory Hays translation of Meditations . It's seriously worth the money. \ntags:\n",

It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor hidden service, and making it require credentials to access and download the file. It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor hidden service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.\nQuick Start\nAt the moment OnionShare is a command line program. It works in normal desktop GNU/Linux distributions, Tails, and Mac OS X. To get started, either git clone the onionshare repository or download this zip file and extract it. Open a terminal and navigate to the  onionshare directory.\nOnionShare relies on Tor. You need to either have a system Tor installed (sudo apt-get install tor), or you can open Tor Browser so that OnionShare can use the Tor server provided there. Start Tor, and then run onionshare.py, passing in the file that you want to share, like this:\n[user@dev onionshare]$ ./onionshare.py ~/secret_files.zip Connecting to Tor ControlPort to set up hidden service on port 51439  Give this information to the person you're sending the file to: URL: http://ryrvuliyyqv5qann.onion/ Username: 0aa7d7266ca05753 Password: d3e6eabad14ea7ad  Press Ctrl-C to stop server   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:51439/ 127.0.0.1 - - [21/May/2014 15:48:50] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 401 - 127.0.0.1 - - [21/May/2014 15:48:59] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 127.0.0.1 - - [21/May/2014 15:49:01] \"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 404 - 127.0.0.1 - - [21/May/2014 15:49:02] \"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 404 - 127.0.0.1 - - [21/May/2014 15:49:03] \"GET /download HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nSecurely send the URL, username, and password to the person you are sending the file to (like by using Jabber and OTR). When they load the website, they will be connecting directly to your computer to download the file. They'll need the username and password to authenticate. Once you confirm that they have downloaded the file you're sending (ask them if they have the file), press Ctrl-C to shut down the server.\nUsing OnionShare in Tails\nYou need to run OnionShare as root in Tails, so make sure you set an administrator password when you boot Tails. Follow the same instructions as above, except run onionshare-tails instead of onionshare.py, and run it with sudo like this:\namnesia@amnesia:~/Persistent/code/onionshare$ sudo ./onionshare-tails ~/Persistent/file_to_send.pgp [sudo] password for amnesia: Connecting to Tor ControlPort to set up hidden service on port 16089 Punching a hole in the firewall\nIn case you're wondering: OnionShare needs root in Tails in order to talk to the Tor ControlPort to create a new hidden service, and also so it can punch a hole in the rigid Tails firewall so that Tor can communicate with the local web server.\n",

            "content": "Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments\nTony Abbotts Coalition Government has taken a severe beating in recent polls following the release of the newest federal budget plans. While the AUD$80 billion slash in funds for health and education over the next ten years has received the most attention, the entrepreneur community is also reeling in palpable frustration.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey announced the abolition of a range of industry assistance programs to save over $845 million. He argues, Businesses should stand or fall on their ability to produce the goods and services that people will actually want. Although this statement affirms the product-market fit mantra, it is ignorant of the fact that Australias start-up community is relatively nascent and still needs support.\nAmong the victims of the budget reform are the Innovation Investment Fund (IIF) and Commercialisation Australia, two important pillars of a support system for Australian technology and innovation. IIF was established to seed venture capital firms and innovative Australian companies. SEEK , one of Australias most successful companies was an early beneficiary of the program. Likewise, Commercialisation Australia  a government initiative offering funding and resources to businesses, researchers, and inventors looking to commercialise innovative intellectual property  will also be killed.\nThe government will replace these initiatives with a single, new service called the Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Program that is due to provide $484.2 million over five yearsto improve the capabilities of small to medium enterprises and streamline business access to government programs. Details of the new program are currently vague and still need to be finalised.\nOn one hand, the government can be seen to be trying to save money and repair the budget  which is genuinely needed. On another, perhaps the government really doesnt know how to manage the organisations and funds to administer them. Take IIF for example, where $130 million of the total $600 million deployed over the course of its sixteen-year existence was spent on various fees and costs. Kim Heras, a Founder of 25Fifteen  a Bondi based start-up incubator says, The government can do a raft of things that make startups a more interesting investment asset class  particularly from a tax perspective  but it cant be handouts. The government needs to support private sector efforts rather than over-administer them.\nAlthough Australia ranks a respectable 19th on the Global Innovation Index ranking by World Intellectual Property Organization , it can do better. Singapore has a quarter of Australias population and ranks eighth in the world. Singapore has also been churning out world-class start-ups with very successful exits. Two notable exits of late are Vikis US$200 million acquisition by Rakuten Rakuten and Zopims $30 million acquisition by Zendesk . As reported by TechinAsia, Zopim received strong support from Singaporean Government grants and investments including the Media Development Authority , SPRING Singapore and the National University of Singapore.\nMore specifically, here are some Singaporean government initiatives that have been crucial to supporting start-ups and that you should know about:\nSPRING  A collection of programs, including ACE , which supports first time entrepreneurs with mentors, networks and funding, and SEEDS , an equity based co-financing option.\nMDA i.Jam  Provides fund matching up to S$100,000 by founders or incubators\nNational Research Fund Technology Incubation Scheme  Co-invests up to 85% of the investment (maximum of S$500,000) by a recommended incubator.\nMoreover, Singapores Government doesnt just throw money to grants. It is also very serious about creating a physical infrastructure for entrepreneurs and start-up support services to co-exist through Block projects . Block-71 was the first government experiment to house start-ups. Originally a dying industrial zone, it has been transformed into a place for entrepreneurs to work and grow together. Singapore now plans to expand the Block projects to three buildings and double the number of companies working in the Blocks from 250 to 500 by the end of the year.\nThe Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) is further ramping up start up support efforts this year with a new acceleration program, an accreditation program to encourage government entities and large enterprises to adopt emerging technologies, and the development of a new fabrication lab to give young people an opportunity to experiment with new hardware electronics and software.\nSingapores government has pumped around S$100 million dollars into its early stage start-ups. This contributes to the extraordinary amount of venture capital funding in Singapore of $1.7 billion last year , a stunning figure when compared to Chinas $3.46 billion. Australia only had a measly $111 million of venture capital injected last year, a drop of 20% from the previous year. There is even fear that Australias venture capital industry could disappear altogether if changes flagged in an upcoming tax review take too long to be implemented, according to Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association chief executive Yasser El-Ansary.\nSome have criticised the amount of over-reaching involvement by Singapores Government to artificially spur innovation and entrepreneurship. However, like a professional lead-out-man cyclist in a Tour De France race, the government is carefully carving a path for start-ups and will eventually fall back; after the ecosystem has gained sufficient momentum and money from successful exits have been recycled into the ecosystem to more naturally propel the next generation of start-ups.\nConversely, the Australian Government seems to be retracting prematurely just as Australias startup environment is heating up. If Australia seriously wants to compete globally, let alone regionally, the government must not diminish the value of its contribution now. Investing into Australian entrepreneurs is an important investment into securing Australias future.\n Follow me on Twitter Twitter  @jaezenlim\n\n",

            "content": "Talking with Mikel Evins about the Lisp-based Newton OS.\nThis text was originally published in 2004.\nIt is little known that an early version of the Newton OS from Apple was written mainly in Lisp. Apple created a Lisp-like language called Ralph. The operating system was called Bauhaus and the development environment was a hacked up version of Macintosh Common Lisp called Leibniz.\nThe shipped version of the Newton OS was very different. Mikel Evins, who worked in the Newton group at Apple, answered a few questions (2004) about the technology on the Yahoo Lisp machine forum. I've edited them a bit and put them online. It all sounds very exciting...\nBauhaus: Newton OS written in Ralph.\nRalph: a Scheme+CLOS variant, later known as Dylan.\nLeibniz: Development environment, MCL plus a Ralph compiler that cross-compiled to the ARM, plus a remote listener.\nMCL: Macintosh Common Lisp.\nQ:  Mikel, I have some questions on the Bauhaus topic. When did the development on Bauhaus happen?\nMikel: Newton development started probably 1989 or so. The Bauhaus project and the Junior project (which became the shipping product)both started some time in late 1992. I worked on Bauhaus until it wascancelled in early 1994.\nQ:  What would be a typical usage szenario of the machine? It was not a small PDA like the released Newton, right?\nMikel: We assumed that people would want a slate-like device in a variety of uses, from personal uses for note-taking and use of a computer that was more convenient than a laptop (laptops were bigger then), and also for a large variety of more specialized uses--for architects, inventory-control specialists, health-care professionals, etc. etc.\nQ:  What kind of applications would have been written for it? Were there any demo applications that were written to show the potential?\nMikel: Yes, but they were fairly thin. Remember that it was only six of us (really five, because Larry spent most of his time being an executive--though I did debug code that he wrote for Bauhaus :-)). and we were writing a whole OS (above the kernel).\nMikel: We had an address book, a note-taking application, various drawing tools, a frame-based general database application (that I called the \"encyclopedia\", a help system, scheduling tools, and other things I don't remember. Matthew, who did our windowing and graphics system, did a bunch of small graphic demos with very slick animations, smooth scrolling, and all sorts of stuff. When it started to look like we were going to be cancelled, he went into overdrive producing code that he hoped would convince management to let us try to build a TV box of some kind on the platform.\nQ:  How much code was it in the OS?\nMikel: Excluding the kernel, between 50,000 and 100,000 lines of code. The leverage was high--we had a user experience that felt fairly rich and complete in that amount of code.\nQ: How many developers have been using the Lisp/Ralph OS?\nMikel: Six: Larry Tesler, Yuying Chow, Ken Dickey, Matthew Maclaurin, Jim Grandy, and me. Plus around a dozen people from other parts of the team when testing it and participating in demos.\nQ:  So, Bauhaus was written in Dylan?\nMikel: When I was working on Bauhaus (and before, on the first iteration of Newton OS) Dylan was even more a Lisp than it is now. It was called \"Ralph\", and was basically Scheme+CLOS+a couple of ideas from other functional languages+a few things to please Smalltalk hackers at Apple.  The development environment was a hacked version of MCL that supported two compilers and runtimes: (1) the Common Lisp Compiler and runtime, which ran on 68K hardware and targeted 68K hardware; and (2) the Ralph compiler and runtime, which ran on 68K hardware, but targeted ARM hardware (first on ribbon-cabled Newton prototype boards, and later on development prototypes of actual Newton hardware connected by means of Nubus inserts). There were lengthy meetings with the Apple Cambridge team that was designing Ralph and various interested fractions at Apple, arguing for their favorite language features. The strongest lobbyists were Lisp and Smalltalk programmers.\nQ:  What would have been the main differences of Bauhaus to the released Newton OS?\nMikel:  Everything above the kernel was written in Dylan, except for 7 very low-level QuickDraw routines. Size in RAM was about twice the size of the C++ version. The UI was a littler richer and a little faster, and built in Dylan using a graphic system made by wrapping those 7 QuickDraw primitives in Dylan and building a graphical language on it.\nMikel: It supported mobile software agents (but there was debate about how this could be made both robust and safe).\nMikel: It had a means of automatically generated UI elements from READ-like forms with class specifications for the arguments; for example, there was a macro get-input-from-user that was like a binding form (like LET*) with class annotations; it dynamically constructed the UI to get the values for the bindings. It had nestable stylesheets for describing the appearance of UI elements (sort of like CSS for UI, but back when the Web was brand new and the W3C What's New page still listed all the websites in the world :-)).\nMiekl: It had a novel event-handling system capable of supporting arbitrary user-defined events. The event system identified events by pattern-matching.\nMikel: It had a frame system used to implement a knowledge base that stored things like prototypical Person and Place and Date objects, and supported fuzzy comparisons. The so-called \"IA\" (\"Intelligent Assistant\") subsytem used these frames so that it could guess things like the fact that when you write \"Joe\" you probably mean \"Joseph Smith\" or \"Josephine Baker\" from your address book. It was also used for the help system, so that it could guess that, for example, a sequence of actions was probably intended to establish a machine-to-machine connection and pop up information to help you do that, and for the event-handling system so that you could declaratively define new classes of high-level events and handlers for them.\nQ:  Sounds a little like MacFrames married with the Newton's soups.\nMikel:  That's no accident! I and the main graphics/windowing guy worked together before on a knowledge-based automated testing system used to qualify System 7 for release; that system was written in MacFrames.  Before that, I wrote a UI modeling system called Panels on MacFrames.\nMikel: The frame system I wrote for Bauhaus also supported relatively elaborate facets and annotations.\nQ:  What kind of high-level events would that be? Could the user define those?\nMikel: Yes. The idea was that you could plug a sequence of lower-level events together and use a property sheet to perhaps parameterize them, thus creating a novel kind of event. Sort of like constructing AppleScripts by recording UI actions, but in smaller, easier to understand and easier to debug pieces. (One of the things I wrote for the automated testing system was an application that watched what the user did and constructed a representation of the observed actions that could be replayed on another system; it represented actions not in terms of low-level MacOS events, but in terms of abstract state transitions described in terms of frames that represented application features, so that moving to a different machine with different screen layout and so forth would not break the playback. Some of the ideas for the event system came from combining that experience with the experience of Jim Grandy, who actually wrote the event system, and who had earlier worked on Garnet.)\nQ:  Was the event propagation like in the released Newton OS, where the  event propagation was on some 'contained in' hierarchy and on the prototype hierarchy (IIRC)?\nMikel: If I remember right, events propagated up a containment hierarchy of visual objects, and were pattern-matched against 'subscriptions' at each layer. (That is, an agent could 'subscribe' to an event pattern and would get a chance to handle any event that matched it as it bubbled up through the containment hierarchy.) The Dylan runtime did not use a prototype hierarchy in the same way as the shipping version; we used generic functions for most of the things they used is-a relations for.\nQ:  Did the IA also support these commands like in the released version with some support for phrases like (from memory): 'add meeting with mike' and then provided some prefilled dialogs? A bit of this reminded me of the CLIM command language, but with some 'richer' syntax.\nMikel: Yes, we supported this. Yu-ying Chow used my frame system to implement more extensive natural-language stuff (and \"concept\" stuff) than the shipping version. We wanted higher-level data types for the user - Person and Date and Place and Activity, defined as frames with a relatively rich pseudo-natural language API and UI.\nQ:  Did it use color?\nMikel: Yes, in the sense of early NeXT machines. :-)\nQ: Was the constructed GUI screen resolution independent?\nMikel: No, though it was adaptive to different screen resolutions. I thought it should have been more vector-based, but the fellow doing the graphics, Matthew MacLaurin, was a very pixel-oriented guy at the time.\nQ: Was the GUI multi-threaded?\nMikel:  No. It would have been eventually; Ken Dickey was hired to implement the threading system, but we got cancelled before that project bore fruit.\nQ:  Was there any use of the mobile agents?\nMikel: Only internally, for experimentation.\nQ:   How different is the development environment from the NewtonScript IDE?\nMikel:  Totally different in every way. It was an application called \"Leibniz\", which was basically MCL plus a Ralph (Dylan) compiler that cross-compiled to the ARM, plus a remote listener for interaction with the ARM-Ralph runtime and other tools (e.g. inspectors, steppers, etc.). It was basically MCL, but with Dylan as well as Common Lisp.\nQ:  Was there some code organization like in the later Dylan Technical Preview? With browsers, where you edit code in-place and the code was more retrieved from a database than edited in files?\nMikel: No, nothing like that. It was really just MCL (though we did have good xref tools). At the time, there was much frustration that Apple Cambridge spent so much time on their new development environment, and not as much as we wanted on making improvements to the Dylan runtime (for example, we hired Ken because we concluded that Cambridge would not get around to threads in time to matter to us). That said, I have nothing but respect for what Apple Cambridge accomplished.\nQ:  Was the User Interface similar to the one shipped with the released Newton?\nMikel:  In some ways, yes, in some ways no. The shipped UI was one of three developed. The original UI was written in Dylan, and had some interesting features (for example, pervasive use of non-rectangular windows), but it was criticized for being slow and for being too much like conventional desktop windowing systems. The engineering group underwent a reset in which 85% went off to rework Newton based on the C++/NewtonScript environment championed by Steve Capps and Andy Stadler, and a few of us were asked to see if we could do a better Dylan-based environment. You've seen the shipped UI. We intentionally tried to make our look like that, but with some additional capabilities, notably more animation and style-able elements based on nested stylesheets.\nQ:  Did the UIMS use generic methods / classes? Or was it prototype-based like the one of the released Newton?\nMikel: It used generic functions and classes, but also many singletons for UI customization, and it used the frame system for reasoning about what to display.\nQ:  Was there a User Interface designer?\nMikel: No. The UI implementor instead spent his time writing a declarative specification language for UI, which was intended to be easy enough to use that you wouldn't need a UI designer. You would control what elements appeared using type annotations, and would control how they looked using the stylesheets. The idea sort of foreshadowed DHTML and CSS and XUL.\nQ:  How did you make sure that the declarative specification language was predictable and delivers enough diagnostic messages for problems/violations/...?\nMikel:  We didn't. It would have been a problem. We would have required interactive graphical tools.\nQ:  What did an application look like? Physical and from a user perspective?\nMikel:  This is an interesting question, because there was some debate about exactly what an application was. In practice, it was usually some frames, plus some UI specifications, plus some style information, plus maybe a few methods and classes. We spent a bunch of time trying to decide how to tell whether it was okay to install something, because we had made it so easy to migrate code from one system to another and to dynamically update the system.\nMikel: User-wise, an application usually consisted of one or more new icons in one of the lists of tasks you could accomplish, plus maybe a new kind of \"paper\" that had either new recognizers or new things you could do with the old recognizers, plus some new pages and prompts in the IA and help, plus maybe some new kinds of objects you could store and search in your frame repository.\nMikel: We were trying to make it possible to make applications simply by plugging pre-existing objects together dynamically.\nQ:  How was the application organized? Was there some application description like a DEFSYSTEM? Was it graphical?\nMikel: In fact, we used a hacked version of mk:defsystem.\nQ:  Was it possible to develop on the machine?\nMikel: No; you needed a Mac running Leibniz. Your Dylan listener ran a REPL on the Newton, but you needed the Mac to talk to it and to compile Dylan code.\nQ:  Wasn't there any need for an interpreter or compiler on the machine?\nMikel:  We thought so; we didn't get around to it before we were cancelled.  There were many ideas that did not get worked out in practice.\nQ:  Was there ever anything written about Bauhaus or is everything in your head?\nMikel: Plenty was written, both documentation and code. A couple of years ago, in response to queries from someone else, I tried to get Apple to give me permission to redistribute both, but they're not interested.  Nowadays I think whatever you can get is in the realm of ideas for discussion.\nQ:  *Why exactly* did Dylan go to an infix syntax? Whose idea was it?\nMikel: That's hard to say. One of the most-commonly-heard complaints in the early language-design meetings was that the new language was a Lisp.  (Naturally, this complaint came only from participants who were not Lisp programmers. Actually, it didn't come from Smalltalk programmers either; they mostly complained that they really wanted the names of functions to be self-documenting in the sense that Smalltalk method selectors are, and they seemed to be satisfied on that point by keyword arguments; and they complained that they wanted stronger encapsulation of private data than typical Lisps give you, and they seemed to be satisfied on that point by the module system).\nMikel: There were repeated and heated arguments about language syntax, with most of the heat coming from non-Lisp, non-Smalltalk folks, who felt strongly that there should be an infix syntax. The implementors, all of whom were Lisp people (one of them was Moon!), seemed pretty much not to care one way or another about syntax, or at least ot have no very strong feelings about it. I was solidly in the Lisp camp, but I actually favored the invention of an infix syntax; I saw it as a harmless addition to make the language more attractive to non-Lispers.\nMikel: I believe now that I was wrong: the infix syntax did not cause Dylan to succeed, and I find it distinctly inferior in practice to the s-expression syntax that I used for several years. As a matter of fact, my favorite programming language of all time is not Common Lisp, but the S-expression-based Dylan (later Dylan versions don't excite me). High on the list of things I would like to see is a new implementation of something very close to that language, with several things designed to bring it forward to today, notably libraries supporting POSIX, multithreaded programming, Internet protocols and data formats, and good XML support. DUIM would be nice, too.\nQ:  Did Ralph make use of Lisp-like macros?\nMikel: Yes, though they were defined in Common Lisp, rather than in Dylan.\nQ:  Dylan vs. Guile (a Scheme).\nMikel: Things the old Dylan had that I would miss in Guile:\nabsolutely everything is an object in the sense of its object system\nnative code compiler\niteration protocol (and the generally well-thought-out collection classes)\ncomparison protocol\na single convenient form for binding single or multiple values\nsingletons (yes, I know it's possible to implement them using the MOP)\nfunctional features like curry, rcurry, compose, complement, disjoin, and so on\nsealing\nthe condition system\nthe module system (I prefer it to that of Guile)\ngrew fond of several Dylan conventions that differ from Scheme (e.g. the use of \"bind\" in place of \"let\")\nMikel: On the other hand, Guile does provide some things I would misss if I had to go back to the old Dylan, notably threads and SRFI support. As I've said above, I'd also like to see a modern Dylan support POSIX and XML and Internet standard protocols and data formats.\nQ:  Was there some memory protection for Dylan apps?\nMikel: Honestly, I don't remember. The microkernel supported such protection; I don't remember whether the Dylan runtime used its fcailities or ran everything out of a single heap.\nQ:  On the relationship between software and hardware groups.\nMikel: When we were working on the various flavors of NewtonOS, the software and hardware groups were not separate. I mean, of course, there were hardware engineers and software engineers, but the overall group was relatively small and everyone worked pretty closely and met together regularly and so on. It is liberating, not only to throw away assumptions about the OS and re-envision it in more congenial terms  (as you said, as a live system, not an undead thing), but also to throw away the assumption that the system is constrained by the hardware that is given off-the-shelf. If you have the sense that it is possible to redesign the hardware, then you can begin to think about what you would like the hardware to be able to do. For example, we decided it would be good if you could carry your Newton around with you and just automatically be on a network whenever you were close enough to a network node. This is commonplace today, but it was blue-sky in 1992.  We had software and hardware both, though, so we could think that way.  The hardware engineers had Macintosh SEs on carts with their guts hanging out and ribbon-cabled to transceivers, testing spread-spectrum comm hardware and associated networking stacks. Those early proto-Newton systems would notice when they got close enough to a repeater to negotiate the appropriate handshakes and automatically put themselves on the net. Crazy in terms of what was available off-the-shelf in 1992, but not at all unreasonable if you are willing to think about new hardware as well as new software.\nEnd of story.\nAddendum:  Also the Newton Toolkit (the development environment) for the released version of the Newton OS (the non-Lisp version) was prototyped in Lisp (Macintosh Common Lisp).\nRainer Joswig, 2012-2014, joswig@lisp.de\n",

It is intended for use by people who discover and report bugs in compilers and other tools that process C/C++ code.  Documentation and other information can be found at the C-Reduce web page: http://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/ --------------------------------------------------------------------  Installation:  see the file INSTALL  --------------------------------------------------------------------  Notes:  1. When set to use more than one core, C-Reduce can cause space in /tmp to be leaked. This happens because sometimes C-Reduce will kill a compiler invocation when a result that is computed in parallel makes it clear that that compiler invocation is no longer useful. If the compiler leaves files in /tmp when it is killed, C-Reduce has no way to discover and remove the files. You will need to do this manually from time to time if temporary file space is limited. The leakage is typically pretty slow. If you need to avoid this problem altogether, you can run C-Reduce on a single core (using \"-n 1\") in which case C-Reduce will never kill a running compiler instance. Alternatively, a command line option such as -pipe (supported by gcc) may suppress the creation of temporary files altogether. Another possibility is to set the TMPDIR environment variable to something like \"/tmp/creduce-stuff\" before invoking C-Reduce -- assuming that the tools you are invoking respect this variable.  2. Each invocation of the interestingness test is performed in a fresh temporary directory containing a copy of the file that is being reduced.

            "content": "| Comments\nAnyone who has attempted to maintain a UI Style Guide over a long period of time will attest that it is a very difficult process. They are generally prioritised below the maintenance of your applications themselves and as such are likely the first candidates to fall behind and the last to be brought out of tech debt.\nThis is bad because once your Style Guide falls out of sync with your application(s) it has entirely lost its purpose. It is no longer a trustworthy representation of the state of your UI and will quickly fall out of favour with the design and development team.\nThis is bad because Style Guides are more than a nicety for developers to show off their style. Done properly, they can be a collaboration tool bridging design and development teams as well as a tool to break down the user interface into its component parts rather than than thinking about it as a whole or as a series of pages. They also serve as a resource for new designers and developers to locate existing patterns for further use.\nThese benefits should be sought regardless of the size or scope of your project but in order to achieve them they cant come at a cost to delivering features. If they do, they will inevitably be neglected.\nAchieving this is a cultural challenge as well as a technological one. At Lonely Planet we managed to accomplish this by making the Style Guide an integral part of our development workflow.\nThis didnt happen easily though, before we found success with our latest attempt we had tried and failed with two earlier approaches and unearthed problems that helped us mould our final solution.\nThe problem with current Style Guide Solutions\nA Static HTML Style Guide\nStyle Guides built with static HTML are standalone representations of your UI components with no direct link to your codebase. Once you change or refactor your HTML or CSS you need to update the Style Guide if you want it to reflect the latest version.\nThe main difficulty with keeping this up to date with your application is having to update both versions of the same template. It requires diligence on the part of all developers to manually keep it up to date.\nI built a static html Style Guide a couple of years ago to try to decipher the UI we had inherited. It gave me some clarity on our UI but didnt fit into our workflow and ultimately didnt make our work any easier. It quickly became a burden to maintain and fell behind and out of importance.\nIts worth mentioning that as a design tool, or as a deliverable to a client who is going to carry on the development, static Style Guides are a fantastic starting point.\nA Living Style Guide\nLiving Style Guides should be the answer to these problems. They autogenerate Style Guides when changes are made to the codebase so in theory they shouldnt be able to fall behind. There are a whole host to choose from and many can be set up with fairly minimal effort.\nBack in 2012 we implemented KSS a fairly popular tool for generating living Style Guides developed by Kyle Neath and used at Github. Unfortunately, it only lasted 2-3 months before it was clear it had diverged from the components within our application.\nSo, given its living, why did it fall behind?\nThe majority of living Style Guide generators work by analysing the CSS: parsing comments within the files to create the documentation and to know which components to render. It makes sense that they would take this approach because CSS is easily analysed and consistent across projects. For a generic library to work across multiple applications it requires a constant to work from but its this key design decision which ultimately makes them hard to maintain.\nThere are a couple of significant ways in which we believe this type of Style Guide is unmaintainable:\n1. Duplication of templates\nThe majority of living Style Guide solutions follow a pattern something like this:\n/* Style Guide [Buttons] <button class=\"btn-primary\">Button</button> <button class=\"btn-secondary\">Button</button> */    .btn-primary {     color: blue;   }    .btn-secondary {     color: red;   }\nHere we have a couple of buttons referenced in the CSS which are rendered in the Style Guide as both elements and markup.\nThe problem here is that the template we render in the Style Guide isnt the template we use in our applications. At best it is a direct copy; more likely it is a slimmed down, and perhaps out of date, copy.\nAs soon as you introduce template duplication like this you have twice as much to maintain. Inevitably, for a project spanning even just a short time, one of them is going to falling behind.\nNow this is easy to overlook when youre talking about single element components like buttons where the effort is fairly minimal to maintain but in reality a lot of components are more complex: requiring multiple elements, classes and often Javascript. We should be striving for a solution which sticks as close as possible to production.\n2. Static HTML Output\nThere is also the problem of the output. Typically you would feature the component alongside the markup required to render it:\n(taken from the excellent Mailchimp Style Guide )\nThe idea here is that a developer can simply copy and paste this markup into their application and very quickly and easily build up their page from component parts.\nWhilst this is an excellent goal, the problem in this case is the distribution of templates. Even if we presume that the rendered markup is absolutely up to date, once they copy that code they are essentially cutting a version which needs to be maintained indefinitely. When they copied the markup for a working component it had an implicit link to a snapshot of the CSS at that point. If you then update the template or refactor the CSS, you need to update all versions of the template scattered around your site.\nThis posed a huge problem for us because authors of components had no idea of where they were being used. They may not even have heard of the application that is now using it. That increases the risk of releasing a breaking which makes it more likely that future developers will avoid updating and reusing the component at all.\nThis is a huge cause for Technical Debt build up at Lonely Planet. As the entire infrastructure is too large to completely hold inside your head, authors were being forced to build defensively. As there was no mechanism for encouraging risk-free reuse of components, they simply werent being reused and we instead ended up with duplicated components and bloated code.\nI dont believe this is an issue scoped only to Lonely Planet or even limited to just large websites. Reducing the distribution of templates promotes easier, risk-free refactoring regardless of the size of complexity of a website.\nHow should Style Guides work?\nThey should focus on the templates. Crucially, if youre rendering templates to a Style Guide and you want it to be maintainable then they cant just be identical to your application templates, they need to be the exact same templates. This is easier said than done.\nTemplates within an application can be written in many different languages and are generally coupled to a data layer, embedded deep into an application and hard to get to. This makes it very hard for a single Open Source tool to parse your templates. It would have to work across a multitude of technologies and disparate application architectures.\nThis doesnt mean its impossible to achieve. It does require your application to be built in a modular, component driven way though. Isolating parts of your UI into small components allows you to reuse them around the site as well as compose them to create greater functionality.\nWithin this type of architecture the Style Guide is able to reach the same components without understanding your entire application. To achieve this can involve a decent chunk of work although the process of restructuring your application into a component based architecture can be the mechanism to simplify and normalise the UI: bringing benefits far beyond the Style Guide itself.\nThis is the process we have taken at Lonely Planet, creating a component layer which both our user-facing applications and our Style Guide can work from.\nBuilding a Component API\nSlides from \"Reducing Complexity with a Component API\"\nI go into more detail on the reasoning behind this process in my Front End Ops talk. The process of decoupling the User Interface from the application, and splitting them into components, had a lot of positive effects on our workflow and codebase.\nThe goals and benefits of a Style Guide were exactly what we wanted but, not knowing how to achieve them, we started by extracting as much of our UI into components and moving them outside of the applications. This also gave us the opportunity to normalise and condense our UI. Once done, we created a very simple API in which to fetch them from the Component Layer. Having the api for us was crucial because we wanted to maintain the mapping between the latest version of the the component and the application, and not have developers copy and paste component code.\nHaving a single version of the component, accessible via an API, worked perfectly with unit testing too so we could ensure that the contract between the API parameters and the returned template was solid. We could modify and extend the component based on the data we passed it and assert on the returned result. This also allowed us to add accessibility helpers and microformat attributes as standard and ensure that they werent forgotten when used in new applications.\nA typical API call:\n// Input   = ui_component(\"forms/search\", {label: \"Search\"})    // Output <form class=\"search--primary\" action=\"//www.lonelyplanet.com/search\"> <label class=\"accessibility\" for=\"search-q\">Search</label> <input class=\"search__input\" id=\"search-q\" name=\"q\" tabindex=\"1\" type=\"search\" value=\"\" /> <button class=\"search__button\" id=\"search-q-submit\" name=\"search-q-submit\" type=\"submit\">Search</button> </form>\nThe developer can modify and extend the component by manipulating the input data. For example, if we wanted to add autocomplete functionality to this search form we would usually do so by adding classes and maybe initialise a JS component somewhere. Within the scope of the Component API we can simply pass in a new boolean and it will add what is necessary:\n// Input   = ui_component(\"forms/search\", {     label: \"Search\", autocomplete: true })    // Output <form class=\"search--primary js-autocomplete\" action=\"//www.lonelyplanet.com/search\"> <label class=\"accessibility\" for=\"search-q\">Search</label> <input class=\"js-autocomplete-input search__input\" id=\"search-q\" name=\"q\" tabindex=\"1\" type=\"search\" value=\"\" /> <button class=\"search__button\" id=\"search-q-submit\" name=\"search-q-submit\" type=\"submit\">Search</button> <div class=\"js-autocomplete-container\"></div> </form>\nStyle Guide Driven Development\nOnce the API is being used to fetch components, all that we really have inside any application are data representations of the components. Its therefore pretty simple to scaffold a quick application that requests every component, multiple times, with differing data. This becomes our Style Guide. Where a regular application might request a handful of components, the Style Guide requests every component, again and again.\nIts always up to date with the rest of lonelyplanet.com because it uses the exact same templates and CSS. As were not just performing static analysis of the CSS we are also able to showcase components that require JS too. It becomes a risk free environment where developers can build and tweak components and then allow them to propagate out to the rest of the applications.\nIn fact, it has become the primary arena for development. Once you have this concept of a component layer it is irrelevant to a developer where they render it for testing. What we have seen is an organic move towards Style Guide Driven Development where developers are using it to build and iterate on components long before they reach any application. This is not something we expected but is certainly a validation of the approach and a polar opposite to our previous attempts where the Style Guide was seen as a blocker to quick feature development.\nAn example component in our Style Guide would showcase the component alongside the API call with data.\nHow it all works\nOur Component Layer, API and Style Guide are combined into an application called Rizzo. The Style Guide is available at rizzo.lonelyplanet.com . One thing I really didnt cover in my talk at Front End Ops Conf was the implementation side of Rizzo and Ive had a lot of questions around it since.\nWe have two different categories of apps that integrate with Rizzo at LP: Rails Apps and Other Apps.\nRails Apps\nRizzo is included as a Gem within all our applications and acts as an engine, thus exposing its partials and assets to the host App. The implementation of the API here is extremely simple and is really just sugar coating around a partial call. The only part that makes this different to just calling a partial is that it lives outside of, and is shareable across, all applications. These helpers act as the API for the Style Guide and the applications.\n-# Called from an application   def ui_component(type, properties)     render \"components/#{type}\", properties   end    -# Called from the Style Guide   def styleguide_component(type, properties)     ui_component \"components/#{type}\", properties     render \"styleguide/description\", type, properties   end\nThere is a little bit more to it but that covers most of how it works. Very, very simple. Its much more a methodology change than it is a technical challenge.\nOther Apps\nNon-ruby apps dont have the luxury of including Rizzo as a Gem (though we may look into using it with other package managers). For now, we host Rizzo as a service and expose HTTP endpoints to return the templates. For example, hitting http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/global-body-header will return the html for part of our header.\nThis adds an extra layer of complexity for these applications as they then have to implement a caching layer for Rizzo components. We cache these templates when the application boots. Its not perfect but given our primary stack is Rails its not something we have spent too much time on yet.\nThe Style Guide\nOnce you have a component architecture your Style Guide can simply be another application. Ours is a tiny Ruby app, but you could use absolutely any technology including a simple static site generator.\nThe Style Guide simply loads up some data for a particular type of component and then iterates through it: rendering the component and the component description each time. Note its calling styleguide_component which ultimately calls ui_component the same as any other application would.\n-# Load the data - cards = YAML.load(File.read(File.expand_path('data/styleguide/cards_stubs.yml', __FILE__))) <h1>Cards</h1> -# Iterate through the data collection and render the components - cards.each do |card|   = styleguide_component(\"cards/#{card[:title]}\", properties: card)\nWith this approach we only have to modify the underlying data to add more components or modify existing ones.\nAssets\nA common question has been how do we handle CSS and JS related to these components. Unfortunately I dont have a clever answer for this at the moment, its a mostly manual process.\nWe split both our CSS and JS out into common and application files. Inside the common.css|js we load the base code as well as our most often used components (stored in /components/core). This is then cached across the entire suite of applications.\nTo use any non-core components within an application the developer would need to import the components related assets using Sass and requireJS.\nI think there is definitely room to improve this process using tools like Component or AssetGraph and its something well be looking into soon. For the moment, it is reasonably trivial to handle manually.\nRizzo on GitHub\nThe source code behind Lonely Planets components is now public at https://github.com/lonelyplanet/rizzo . The implementation is very bespoke to Lonely Planet but should give some indication of how our architecture works if you are interested in taking a similar approach. Here are a few example pieces that make up Rizzo:\n",

            "content": "Go Read: One Year with Money and App Engine\n13 Mar 2014\nGo Read began life one year ago . It began life the same day of the Google Reader shutdown announcement . It was released to the public in late June of 2013, and has been profitable since the start. I have never run a business, and was surprised that Go Read was profitable. I assumed it was operating at a slight loss, especially those first few months.\nFor 2013, total subscription income was $7129 ($1188 per month). Total App Engine expense was $4048 ($647 per month). I'd like to discuss what I did to increase subscription income and decrease server costs.\nincreasing income\nGo Read is free . Its servers are not. I had hoped that its costs would have been low enough for me to handle myself, but at hundreds of dollars per month, I quickly changed my mind. I tried many approaches that did not work until the current one that does.\nvolunteer payments\nThe first attempt was completely voluntary. I added a way to subscribe for $3/month or $30/year. However, it didn't actually do anything besides remove the button asking you to subscribe. There were no added features or removed ads. This yielded a few subscriptions, but not enough to cover costs. Many people were clearly happy to pay this early on, but most wanted to use it for free.\nads for free\nThe second change was to display ads for non payers. I tried out Google's ads, both text and graphic. I did get enough click-throughs for a low income that may have covered its own server fees. Showing ads on an RSS reader, presented a few problems. First, it made the experience annoying and buggy. Second, it is impossible to meet Google's terms of service with an RSS reader. They dictate that ads may not be shown along adult or copyrighted content. Determining that for external sources of data was not going to happen. I got a few emails about violations and added a system to prevent ads on certain feeds. But I was playing whack-a-mole and it would never end. Eventually I made a mistake and they banned my site. I gave up on ads at this point.\n30-day trial\nThe current system is the 30-day trial. You can try Go Read for free with all its features for 30 days. This includes the android app. At the end you must pay or go away. Most other paid feed readers have a free tier, but they limit the number of feeds you can view. I have never liked this because you can't ever get a full experience of the app with all of your feeds. Furthermore, I had already decided to not pay for other folk's server costs out of my pocket. Go Read is free software and takes minutes to run your own production instance, so there's no reason to complain.\nThis action cost me about 90% of my users. Many were angry and cursed at me on twitter. I agree that it is sad I did not say I was going to charge from the beginning, but I didn't know that I would be paying hundreds of dollars per month either. Again, it's free software so I'm not sure what the problem is. I learned from this experience that some people will never pay, and some will. I'm not opposed to alienating people who won't support all of the time, effort, and money I put into this product.\nForcing people to pay was the best choice I have made. Due to so many users leaving I was able to reduce costs greatly (now much less than $10/day) and providing a decent profit. I believe I would pay for some of the free services I used if they forced me to pay or leave.\ndecreasing expense\nFor the App Engine-inclined of you, let's talk about quotas. App Engine provides a generous free quota that allows you to test almost any app on Google's production servers with real data. Until you get some real users you'll be below the limit. Go Read works on the free tier for some hundreds of feeds (number of users is not a factor for Go Read).\nFor the first few weeks, App Engine was costing me around $50/day. This was right after the HN and gizmodo posts. I got 20k users signed up in 3 days. That was around 800k feeds, and a few million new stories per day. Lots of data coming in. Even updating the feeds at 20/s wasn't enough to keep up. Today, I have a few hundred active users and probably a few thousand feeds. Costs have dropped to about $6/day. Quite manageable.\ndo less things\nA simple rule in computers is to make something run faster, have it do less work. I remember reading about how grep works quickly. Instead of splitting a file by lines and then searching for the string, it searches for the string, then finds the newlines on either side. Thus, if a file has no matches, it won't ever have to do the work for line splitting. Done the naive way, it would always split by line even if there was no match. Do less work.\nFeed updates were happening every 6 hours for all feeds. But many feeds are updated less than once per week. The first change was to optimize how feed update times are chosen. Rarely updated feeds were checked less frequently. A slight improvement and performance and cost.\nWhen users decide to leave Go Read, and they are the only user of a certain feed, we can detect when it is no longer being viewed. Feeds that haven't been viewed for a month are no longer updated. The data is still there. If the user returns they will resume like normal. This was the most effective cost-reduction technique we used.\nstore less things\nApp Engine charges for data stored in its amazing datastore (my favorite feature of App Engine and the only feature I'm aware of that has zero competitors in the cloud space. When you compare to AWS prices, no one mentions the datastore.) After six months I had 500GB of data (about half of which was indexes). This was costing me about $3/day (and increasing) in just stored data (not counting access the data). Blobstore (where feed favicons and opml uploads) was in the $1/day range. Not a lot, but it adds up per day. I ran some cleanup code to delete unused blobs so I'm now under the free blobstore limit. Another large batch job deleted feed items for feeds not viewed in the last 90 days. This cleared up about 60% of the used datastore space. Overall a savings of almost $3/day. Not too interesting, but useful.\noverall expenses\nExpenses now are so cheap that I expect my profits to rise even though income is not. Optimizing for use is one of the tricky parts of App Engine. But if you want to use App Engine, you have to do it the App Engine way .\nconclusion\nPutting work into a product that is profitable is a lot of fun. I'm pleased that something I put hundreds of hours and thousands of commits into is enjoyed and used by other users. I hope that Go Read continues to be useful and valuable enough to others that they are happy to pay for it.\nRelated Posts\n",

            "content": "principles of high performance programs\nPosted on\nby arvid\nThis article is an attempt to sum up a small number of generic rules that appear to beuseful rules of thumb when creating high performing programs. It is structured by first establishing some fundamental causes of performance hits followed by their extensions.\nmemory latency\nA significant source of performance degradation on modern computers is the latency of SDRAM. While the CPU is waiting for a read from memory to come back, it is typically idling (this is mitigated by hyper-threading, to allow switching to another hardware thread, that may have work to do that doesnt have an immediate dependency on RAM).\nThe main optimization to hide the latency of RAM, is layers of cache on top of it. Most modern CPUs have megabytes of cache.\ncontext switching\nWhenever the CPU switches context, the memory it will access is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing. This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is slow.\nA context switch doesnt necessarily need to be two threads sharing a single core. Making a system call, which is run in kernel mode, also switches context. One of the most important factors in the cost of system calls (these days, with SYSENTER), is the eviction of your cache by the kernel while executing the system call. There is an interesting paper on this, exploring the option of making system calls asynchronous, and deferred, to avoid having to switch context for every call [1].\nbatching work\nIn order to avoid the cost of context switches, it makes sense to try to invoke them as rarely as possible. You may not have much control over operating systems system calls. There are a few cases where system calls have variants meant to reduce the number of calls you need to make, like writev() and readv() (or even better, pwritev() and preadv()). By passing in a vector of buffers, you dont need to make one system call per buffer. By also passing in the read or write offset, you save one call to lseek() (as well as being thread safe).\nHowever, you do have a lot of control over how your program is organized. Specifically how your threads communicate and how they behave. By batching work done by your threads you will get more work done per context switch, and you will improve performance.\nKeep in mind the discreet nature of computers. You will wake up some times, there are only weak guarantees of when, and you have a chance to do some work. Do not rely on or expect to be able to wake up on a schedule, at least not with very high accuracy.\nmagic numbers\nWhen batching work, it may be tempting to invent magic numbers. Things like: when 100 jobs are accrued, wake-up and perform them, then go back to sleep. Or perhaps: wake up once every 100 ms and perform all jobs that have accrued during that time.\nA general rule of thumb is that magic numbers will not scale. They will either be a poor fit for slow throughput environments (e.g. waking up every 100 ms may be way too often and would waste CPU) or a poor fit for high throughput environments (it takes 1 ms to accrue 100 jobs, and waking up every millisecond is too often).\nA typical manifestation of this problem is buffers with fixed sizes.\nThe latter is probably the most likely to be a problem. Computers are likely to become faster (at least more parallel) and throughput is likely to increase. Formulating your program so that it has to be configured for a certain era of computers or environment will require you to spend more time tweaking it.\nadapt to the natural granularity of the computer\nThe granularity of the computer is the default time slice size in the operating systems scheduler. Ideally, a CPU would not context switch any more frequently than this (with the exception of context running out of work of course). This can typically not be achieved, when system calls are synchronous and considered context switches, but it is worth keeping in mind for the context switches one does have control over.\nEvery time a thread wakes up, the program has incurred a certain cost of context switching to it. To minimize this cost, it needs to be amortized over as much work as possible. Heres rule of thumb 1:\nAlways complete all work queued up for a thread before going back to sleep.\nThis rule is commonly applied in networking applications when a socket becomes readable. When a typical network application is notified of a socket becoming readable, the socket is repeatedly read until returning EWOULDBLOCK (i.e. the socket receive buffer is drained).\nNot draining the readable socket would cause the thread to go back to sleep, just to immediately be woken up again, because one of its sockets is readable.\nA basic property of a program whose batch size adapts to the load is that your work/thread-wakeup ratio will increase as your load increases. This will cause your wakeup cost to be amortized over more productive work, and increase your throughput.\njob queues\nA common pattern for allowing a program to take advantage of multiple CPU cores is to have threads or thread pools which can have work items queued up on them. The threading primitives used for job queues are typically condition variables or semaphores. Both of these primitives need to go all the way down to the kernel to wake up the thread waiting for jobs. Waking up, or signaling a thread to wake up, is not free. It should not be done more than necessary. There are at least two reasonable ways to limit the amount of redundant signaling between a producer and consumer thread. Which leads us to rule of thumb 2:\nWhen awake, have your thread complete all its work before committing the work that it produced.\nCommitting work here refers to to diving down into the kernel to wake up the worker thread to perform queued work. Another way to phrase this is to commit the work produced by handling messages when the message queue is empty.\nMany high-level event frameworks dont expose the message queue at such a low level. Theres no hook to trivially trigger a commit each time the queue drained. This is true for boost.asio for instance. A way to implement a commit-when-drained handler on top of such message queue is to simply post a message to the queue whenever a new job is queued up (that will need committing later), unless such message is already in-flight. This calls your handler at least once per going through the whole message queue. The number of messages in the message queue will scale with load, and increase your batch sizes (and performance) organically.\nHeres a brief example of this concept:\nvoid peer_connection::on_read(error_code const& ec    , size_t bytes_transferred) {  // run logic to drain data from socket, handle messages and  // queue up disk jobs triggered by them  m_session.defer_commit(); }  void session::defer_commit() {  if (m_pending_commit) return;  m_io_service.post(bind(&session::on_commit_jobs, this));    m_pending_commit = true; }  void session::on_commit_jobs() {  assert(m_pending_commit);  m_pending_commit = false;    // wake up disk thread to handle the jobs queued up on it  m_disk_thread_pool.wake_up(); }\nAnother way to achieve adaptive batching in job queues is to only signal the thread to wake up when the number of jobs in the queue goes from 0 to > 0. As long as the number of jobs in the queue stays above 0, the worker thread(s) wont go to sleep voluntarily (just by the scheduler granularity). This may achieve lower latencies for jobs, but may also scale the batch size less.\nThere is a cost associated with signaling a thread. The red portions of the threads represent that cost. Batching jobs and signaling fewer times, is more efficient.\nExample: writing to sockets in libtorrent\nlibtorrent uses boost.asio as its event dispatch library. It has a straight forward message queue which ties callbacks to any event the application is subscribed to. In a bittorrent client, incoming messages on one peer connection may induce outgoing messages on other peers connections. For example, when receiving the last bit of a piece message form a peer, we may end up completing it and we should send HAVE messages to all peers, indicating that we now have this piece. Perhaps more importantly, multiple disk read job may compete and queue up 16 kiB of data on the send buffer each.\nAs established earlier, it is desirable to write these messages to sockets in as few system calls as possible. To achieve this, libtorrent corks all peers by default. Whenever a message is handled that puts data on a peer connection, it is not written to the socket right away. Instead, the connection is added to an uncork-set of peer connections. In the same way the on_commit_jobs() is called in the code snippet above, libtorrent uncorks all peers once the message queue is drained.\nThis has the benefit of potentially merging writes to sockets, and using fewer system calls to write. As the uncorking is done via a message posted to the queue, the cork batch size will grow organically with the load, and batch up more at higher loads.\nExample: socket receive buffers\nWhen reading from sockets, the batching problem also manifests itself. How does one determine how large ones receive buffers should be? If theyre too big, youre wasting memory and may not run well in a low bandwidth low memory environment. If the buffers are too small, you may need to wake up too often to drain them, wasting context switches in high bandwidth environments.\nThere are primarily two approaches to reading data from sockets (or files). The posix way is to be notified when a socket is readable, then repeatedly call read() on it until it is drained. To avoid repeated system calls, one can call ioctl()FIONREAD to first find out how many bytes are available and set ones buffer size optimally. This approach makes it easy to find the optimal buffer size, and not wake up any more often than necessary.\nThe second approach (win32) is to allocate a buffer up front and pass that into the asynchronous read call. This has the obvious advantage of not having to copy the data from the kernel buffer, but receive directly into the user supplied buffer. Other benefits include having a more predictable memory usage, where the application has some control over the growth of buffer sizes.\nThe problem of setting fixed buffer sizes is that it implicitly says: this program will never receive more than n bytes while this thread is asleep. Setting n to a reasonable number is impossible, it will either be too big or too small, depending on the environment. The first approach has the benefit of letting the operating system grow the buffer size as needed when the time between wake-up or download rate increases. The problem with the first approach is the need for copying the data.\nRule of thumb 3:\nAllocate memory buffers up front to avoid extra copying and maintain predictable memory usage.\nHow can we take advantage of the zero-copy API but still organically adapt our buffer size to the throughput of the machine and network?\nStart by allocating a reasonably large buffer, receive asynchronously into it. If the number of bytes you receive fills the buffer entirely, you can assume you would perform better by increasing the buffer size. Conversely, if the number of bytes is significantly less than the buffer size, you may want to make it smaller, to save RAM. In order to make the buffer size converge in reasonable time, the adjustments should be multiplicative.\nExample: communicating with disk thread in libtorrent\nAnother example of how to apply the rule of organically adapt the job batch size to the load is the disk cache in libtorrent. Peers that want to read from the disk need to allocate disk buffers (out of the disk cache) that are then submitted in disk read jobs to the disk thread pool. When peers are receiving payload that is destined for the disk, they also first allocate a disk buffer to receive the data into. Once a buffer is full, it is submitted as disk write job to the disk thread pool.\nWhen the disk cache runs out of free buffers, peers may have to wait for buffers to be flushed to disk and made available before they can continue receiving more data from their sockets. These peers will be put in a queue and woken up at some later point when there are buffers available. The problem here is, how does one determine when to wake up these peers? There needs to be some low watermark, when the cache use drops below this line, we can wake up the peers and have them allocate their buffers and keep going.\nRule of thumb 4:\nWhen determining your batch size, think about what a natural division is without using magic numbers. It often involves the number of jobs (or bytes) one accrues during the time it takes for your thread to wake up after having been signaled, or during one scheduler time slice.\nIn the case of the low watermark for a disk cache, one obvious property one would want is to not wake up a peer, for it to just find itself unable to allocate another buffer, because they have all been allocated again. The low watermark should be at least as low as (max_size  num_waiters) buffers. i.e. no peer should be woken up until theres at least one free block each. Setting the low watermark any lower runs the risk of unnecessarily delay peers from making progress. The number of waiters will depend on the load, and effectively adjust the low watermark accordingly.\noperating system APIs\nIf these rules of thumb were to be taken into account when designing an API for an operating system, you could end up with significantly higher performing programs.\nThis section highlights a few sub optimal interfaces to todays operating systems.\nReading from and writing to UDP sockets is done one packet at a time. the vector read and write calls will coalesce the buffers into a single packet. When implementing a transport protocol on top of UDP, say uTP, one may have hundreds of packets prepared to be sent at a time, but still will need to call the send() function once per packet. The same thing goes for reading packets off of a UDP socket. There is no system call that returns all packets available on the socket. This is suboptimal and causes many unnecessary context switches.\nAlso, the posix networking API does not support the application allocating buffers up-front, and have the network card receive bytes directly into them. Windows API supports this, and can (at least in theory, if the driver supports it) avoid copying data from the kernel buffer into the user buffer. With an API that supports passing in pre-allocated buffers, it would be nice to have better support for communicating with the user level what a reasonable buffer size would be.\nMany of the problems with requiring multiple system calls would be solved, however, if all system calls were asynchronous. In order to optimally take advantage of asynchronous system calls, message queue would probably have to be a central concept, with deep kernel support. This is not unlike epoll, kqueue, I/O completion ports, and solaris ports.\nImagine a world where all system calls are asynchronous, all events and system calls return values are posted onto a message queue and you could drain the message queue with a single interaction with the kernel.\nSummary\nThe ideas presented in this article can be summarized as:\nThe principle of organically adapt your job-batching sizes to the granularity of the scheduler and the time it takes for your thread to wake up.\nA mechanism to adapt receive buffer sizes for sockets, while at the same time avoiding to copy memory out of the kernel.\nSuggestions on how an operating system (and any API) can be shaped to better scale its performance\nOnly signal a worker thread to wake up when the number of jobs on its queue go from 0 to > 0. Any other signal is redundant and a waste of time.\nCork sockets in order to merge as many writes as possible\nA pattern to support committing-work-when-queue-is-drained to a high-level message queue\n\n",

            "content": "Static Electricity Defies Simple Explanation\n15 May 2014 2:45 pm\nStatic Electricity Defies Simple Explanation\nIf youve ever wiggled a balloon against your hair, you know that rubbing together two different materials can generate static electricity. But rubbing bits of the same material can create static, too. Now, researchers have shot down a decades-old idea of how that same-stuff static comes about.\nThe same-material phenomenon produces important real-world effects, such as generating lightning in volcanic eruptions, gumming up the processing of powders in manufacturing, and causing explosions in grain elevators. Physicists thought they understood what was going on, but suddenly \"the dominant theory appears to be dead,\" says Troy Shinbrot, an applied physicist at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, in New Jersey who was not involved in the new work.\nThe balloon trick involves rubbing two different insulating materialsyour hair and the latex of the balloonthat hold on to electric charges with different strengths. So more positive electric charge builds up on one and more negative charge collects on the other. Like charges repel one another, which explains why your hair then stands on end. You might think that rubbing pieces of the same material wouldn't create static, as they hold charges with the same strength. But charging can happen if the pieces are of different sizes. In 1986, John Lowell and William Truscott of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in the United Kingdom explained how that might work.\nThey imagined rubbing a small insulating sphere across a plane of the same material, which stands in for a large object. They assumed that the two surfaces were speckled with energetic electrons trapped at random spots, presumably because they had been kicked out of their usual lower energy niches within the material. When surfaces touch, the negatively charged electrons can jump from their high-energy perches on one surface to low-energy states on the other.\nIf equal numbers of electrons hopped in both directions, nothing much would change. But that's where the size difference comes in. As Lowell and Truscott explained it, only one point of the sphere touches the plane, and it has just a few electrons to give and a larger number of empty states with which to absorb them. In contrast, a larger streak of the plane comes in contact with the sphere, so it has plenty of electrons to give. So more electrons hop from plane to sphere than vice versa, leaving the sphere negatively charged and the plane positively charged and creating the static. Other researchers showed how the theory could apply to grains of two different sizes.\nUnfortunately, the theory doesn't work, report Heinrich Jaeger, a physicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois, and colleagues. They mixed grains of insulating zirconium dioxide-silicate with diameters of 251 micrometers and 326 micrometers and dropped them through a horizontal electric field, which pushed positively charged particles one way and negatively charged particles the other. They tracked tens of thousands of particlesby dropping an $85,000 high-speed camera alongside them. (See video above.) Sure enough, the smaller ones tended to be charged negatively and the larger ones positively, each accumulating 2 million charges on average.\nThen the researchers probed whether those charges could come from electrons already trapped on the grains' surfaces. They gently heated fresh grains to liberate the trapped electrons and let them \"relax\" back into less energetic states. As an electron undergoes such a transition, it emits a photon. So by counting photons, the researchers could tally the trapped electrons. \"It's pretty amazing to me that they count every electron on a particle,\" Shinbrot says.\nThe tally showed that the beads start out with far too few trapped electrons to explain the static buildup, Jaeger says. In fact, even if the researchers try to make trapped electrons boil up to the surface by exposing the grains to light, the density of trapped electrons remains less than 1/100,000 of what would be needed to explain the effect , the researchers report in a paper in press at Physical Review Letters.\n\"They show pretty convincingly that the idea of the transfer of these trapped electrons is not valid,\" says Daniel Lacks, a chemical engineer at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, who applied the Lowell and Truscott theory to granular materials.\nIf the grains aren't swapping electrons, then where do the charges come from? They could come from hydroxide ions in a layer of water a molecule thick that inevitably coats the grains, Jaeger speculates. Or the charging could involve the transfer of the zirconium material from grain to grain, notes Keith Forward, a chemical engineer at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.\nDetermining which scenario is right may be tough. Repeating the experiment under conditions that would eliminate any water would be very difficult, Jaeger says. Forward suggests that it might be easier to try to detect the presence of hydroxide ions using chemistry. Solving this little mystery could help materials scientists and engineers control the effect, which could be a boon to drug manufacturers and other industries.\n(Video credit: Scott Waitukaitis and Heinrich Jaeger, the University of Chicago)\nPosted In:\n",

            "content": "The Most Entertaining Guide to Landing Page Optimization You'll Ever Read\nMay 20th, 2014\nThe author's posts are entirely his or her own (excluding the unlikely event of hypnosis) and may not always reflect the views of Moz.\nLanding pages rule. Blah.\nDo some A/B testing. Blah.\nBase your optimization strategy on customer feedback. Blah.\nAll of those statements are true. But they sound boring and being boring is lame. It's twenty fourteen and I refuse to be lame.\nIf you want to be a non-lame marketer, it's really easy. Read this post, have a laugh, and treat everything I say as gospel.\nBe warned, however, that I may descend into telling bad jokes in the absence of witty metaphor and charming anecdotal rhetoric.\nThe experienced adult readers amongst you might remember that \"Shit. The condom broke!\" moment. Yeah you do. You might also remember that it felt like a  good time to run a test. #STDsArentFunny. Perhaps. But, as we go through this epic journey together today, I'll show you exactly when and how you should  really be testing.\nBut first. The best 7-part list of bullet points you'll ever read.\nThe start of the best part of your day begins now with this table of contents:\nFirst I'll give you the only rationale you'll ever need to explain why landing pages are to marketers, what Immodium is to an astronaut with    diarrhea. Essential.\nI'll prove why context - not content - is king when it comes to conversion.\nFollowing that, I will make you fall in love with forms. FYI, it's really, really hard to make form love a \"thing\".\nMid way through we'll sip some Canadian Club, get our Don Draper on, and learn how to write copy like the Mad Men (and Women).\n\"Paint me a pretty picture Johnny!\" \"Screw you mommy. Design is not just rainbows and unicorns!\"\nIs it greedy to want a second helping when you're an orphan? Not if you have my name. (It's Oliver in case you're confused). Always ask for more    when it comes to conversion .\nAnd finally, I'll put my art critic hat on and rip into some landing page examples, both good and bad.\nChallenge laid down. Challenge accepted (on your behalf).\nChapter 1: Why landing pages rule, and why you should never send campaign traffic to your homepage\nIf I've got your attention thus far, it's probably because you can't bear to tear your eyes away from my enchanting prose.\nThe only important word in that sentence is ATTENTION.\nAttention is a state of mind that you can't assume your visitors will even enter if you don't give them the right conversion experience.\nA good conversion experience is one in which your visitors are compelled to pay attention and ultimately interact with your conversion goal - clicking the  Call-To-Action (CTA).\nA bad conversion experience is one in which your visitor is compelled to run away.\nThere are three sides to attention that we need to consider:\nCapturing your visitor's attention\nMaintaining your visitor's attention\nFocusing your visitor's attention\nYour ad covers point #1, and landing pages are the answer to solve numbers 2 and 3, so let's start with number 2.\nGenius Insight #1: attention ratio\nPay attention as I set the scene.\nLet's say you're running a marketing campaign for a promotion:\n\"50% off Miley Cyrus Twerkout* DVDs\"\n* I'm claiming a  on that brilliant piece of branding.\nGot your attention, right?\nWith that in mind, consider the two diagrams below. The first is a typical homepage, and the second is a campaign specific landing page.\nThe Homepage\nOn this homepage, your Twerkout campaign is represented by \"promo 2\" highlighted by the red circle.\nThe rest of the page is comprised of a few other Miley promotions, some tour dates, navigation, a general brand proposition about how Hanna Montana is no  longer a thing, a photo slider, footer navigation and many other page \"leaks\".\nIf you send people to your homepage - from a paid ad, email or social media - the intended campaign conversion goal has to fight to get their attention  with all of the other interactive elements on the page.\nA typical homepage has approximately 40 links.\nIn the example opposite there is actually a total of 56 links, therefore:\nThe attention ratio is 56:1\n#puke\nHey, don't just take my word for it. This overstimulus has impacted many other people's lives according to Princeton University wuuut!\nPrinceton neuroscientists found out the more stuff you have around you, the more each piece of  stimulation competes for \"neural representation\"--that is, your attention.\nBack to our scientific marketing experiment. Let's now consider the Twerkout promotion on a dedicated, campaign-specific landing page.\nThe Landing Page\nOn a campaign-specific landing page, the entire page is focused on only one thing, the Twerkout DVD campaign.\nThe messaging is very tightly related to the campaign goal and has only 1 interactive element - the CTA.\nThe attention ratio is 1:1\n#slapmyassandcallmemileythatsgood\nLet's look at an example of someone doing this right. Salesforce is a company with an incredibly complex product offering. Their website is a cacophony of  possible pathways.\nIf you dig deep into the site, their primary goal seems to be to get you signed up for a product demo. Not surprising given the complexity of their  software.\nSo what happens when you search for Salesforce in Google? The first organic result will take you to the homepage. But the first paid ad (right at the top  of the page) takes you to a different page entirely. Presumable because you typed in their name and are showing a level of prior knowledge.\nThe page you arrive at looks like this:\nIt's a great landing page. Entirely focused on a single goal. To get you to watch a demo of any of their products. The headline and CTA could use a bit  more mention of the purpose of the page (watching a demo). Also, take a look at the button. It's the same colour as the form container. DON'T DO THAT! Use  some contrast Salesforce.\nAside from those things, it's a really nicely designed, focused experience.\nOne last example. Where would you look/click in this situation?\nHow about now?\nGot it? Never feed your marketing traffic to a peacock, unless you've poked his eyes out.\nThe feather ones, not his actual eyeballs! Wow, you're sick.\nGenius Insight #2: conversion coupling\nYou are now 50% of the way to being smarter than 98% of all marketers.\n( In good company )\nSynergy. That's what I'm talking about. Uck. What a gross word.\nHere's the second piece of most of almost everything you need to know to be the cleverest person in the room at any marketing conference. Try saying that  fast.\nIn more detail it's comprised of one or more of the following:\nMessage match: Matching the copy of your ad to the headline of your landing page.\nDesign match: Matching the design of your display ad to the design on your landing page.\nLet's look at the good and the bad of them.\nMessage match\nTo expand, message match is the idea of matching the pre-click message to the post-click message on your landing page, with the goal of making people think  they made a \"good click\".\nThe messaging on the page reinforces the reason for their click, reducing/removing confusion.\nHere's an ad for a startup I'll be working on after Unbounce:\nIf that link sent you to a homepage, the target headline may look something like this:\nGet More Projects Done With Less Management\nThis may or may not be a good headline for expressing the brand value proposition, but it doesn't match the ad at all. Result? Bad message match.\nThe correct headline in this instance would be:\nProject Management Software Without Deadlines\nResult? It matches the headline of the ad perfectly, and thus it's great message match. Ding, ding, ding. Got it?\nTo build really strong message match, use the subhead of your landing page to reiterate the main point of your ad's description.\nThis example introduces aspects of a concept called conversation momentum, which I'll get to in part 2. But basically you can see that the subhead repeats  the end of the ad description \"Deadlines are dead.\" and finishes the sentence like people do when they're in the gushy part of a relationship \"Choose  procrastination instead\".\nAnd it rhymes. #doublerainbow\nHere are some good and bad examples of message match from the Google\nCarrying on the thread, I searched for \"Project management software for teams\".\nHere's what I found:\nExcellent match for the headline and the form header (Try it Free >> Try Smartsheet For Free).\nLet's do that again:\nThere's no message match here. I was expecting \"Project Management Software\" and I got \"DIY Custom Apps For Improving Team Productivity.\"\nNot to mention the attention ratio, which is a whopping 35:1 not including the 40 links in drop-down menus.\nTake a look at the page if we remove all of the distractions:\nSo much better! The Attention Ratio is 1:1 and it's much clearer what you're supposed to do.\nAnd, going back to the ad:\nWhy shorten \"management\" to \"mgmt\" just to throw both Intuit AND Quickbase in there? To me, that's brand overload. I like to think of paid ads that are not  based on a branded search as needing an application of \" Message Before Brand.\" Your brand experience will be introduced after they sign up or through the  communication of your page copy. Throwing your name in the ad can waste precious space with a name that people might not be familiar with.\nNow I say this based on most companies that don't have a pervasive brand that could benefit from this tactic. If however you are doing TV ads and a lot of  other brand exposure work, then this could be a beneficial tactic to catch people's eye. But I'd rather add 2-3 more value based words in the headline and  relegate the brand name to the 2nd or 3rd row of the ad.\nSidenote: I would love to know some results of this level of branding in paid ads if someone has tested it.\nI dare you to search for something that is of importance to your life and do a clickathon. The experiences are shockingly shocking.\nSo that's message match!\nBoom. Insights. You're so lucky to be reading this. Next.\nDesign match\nThis is one of the easiest techniques to master. Take the design on your display (banner) ad and repeat it on your landing page.\nDeep breath.\nThis time I'll start with the good side of the force. Example courtesy of RBC Canada via Facebook.\nThe Facebook ad:\nThe landing page:\nNot only is the message match perfect (100% perfect - can perfect be less than 100%?), the design match also kicks ass. That little dude is following you  around with his little sign, letting you know he cares.\nHOWEVER. Take a look at the landing page in detail, the page does suffer from Attention Ratio deficiencies (7:1) and the CTA is horribly small. If you did  a squint test (squint your eyes from a distance and see what stands out on the page) - you'd see the trust seal, not the CTA.\nTo improve this, the different options for applying for an account could be on the next page after the click has confirmed interest.\nAnd the CTA would be a lot clearer if it was designed to be bigger with a strongly contrasting button color.\nBrain break! Go smoke, pee, or text your life partner. I'll wait 'til you're back.\nChapter2: Context is king, queen, emperor, and boss\nThe more testing I do the more I keep coming back to one central concept. Context. In this section I'll show you a few examples of context in action.\nBut first, a couple of definitions with names that I invented. #yourewelcome #payattention.\n2.1 Conversation momentum\nThe purpose of Conversation momentum is to remove the break in communication that can occur when the click is made. If you're wooing someone in an email or  blog post, it makes sense to continue to do so on the landing page.\nYou wouldn't invite someone into your house then act like you had never met them would you?\nA big portion of this concept is respect. Respecting the click, respecting the time you want your visitor to invest.\nImagine this line is in your email.\n\"Let me show you how our product/service can help.\"\nSometimes a good way to preserve momentum is to express gratitude to your visitor for showing up.\n\"I'm glad you were interested in learning more about {words that were on the link}.\"\nCreating a delightful experience humanizes the relationship and shows you care.\nIt's important to get to the point quickly (like a short email), but you should do so in a way that flows naturally.\n\"One of the important things to know about {words in the link} is that it can {establish the benefit}.\"\nGetting warmer.\n\"What our solution does is to make {words in link} much easier to do. If you want to take it for a spin, I'll pay the first month for you. And I'm  personally available if you fancy a chat about the best way to use it.\"\nHow yummy is that?\nNow consider the lame-o, commonplace, and rude approach:\n\"Let me show you how our product/service can help.\"\n\"We're the best {what we do} in the world. Sign Up Now.\"\nWhat? You stopped caring about me, and now you sound generic and only interested in yourself.\nConversation Momentum Case Study - Ecourse to landing Page\nTo show how conversation momentum works in action, take a look at the CTA in the top-right corner of the page below.\nEstablishing context\nThis page is from an 11-part course about landing page optimization , primarily written by me. It's driven  by an email drip campaign where I speak to people in a very personal way. So anyone who is on a course page has received between 2-13 emails from me. My  mugshot is also in the sidebar of every page.\nSidenote: The course is now ungated (no form) so there are no more emails. But up until this point there were.\nAt first I was sending this traffic to a rather generic landing page that has our standard value proposition headline:\nThe conversion goal of this page was a simple click on the orange call to action.\nTo improve the sense of context, I made three changes to the page design, producing the version below:\nThe changes were:\nA co-branded header. The idea here is represent the before and after of the experience. You came from the ecourse, expressed interest in Unbounce,    and are now having Unbounce presented to you.\nA conversational headline that again connects with where you came from and introduces the purpose of the page.\nA personal message from me (the familiar face of the ecourse).\nThe result? a 77% lift in conversions.\n2.2 Context of use\nContext of use can be defined as providing a visual demonstration of how your product or service will be used by a customer.\nAnd I can't underline strongly enough how important it is for conversion. Actually I can - how important it is for conversion << that's not a link.\nHere's an example:\nThink of that guy Vince from the Slap Chop and ShamWow commercials. Annoying? Definitely. A role model for your children? Absolutely not. Excellent  illustrations of context of use? Mos def.\nYou know exactly how to use them and what the outcome and experience will be like.\nThat's context of use. Check out this next case study:\nContext of use case study - landing page templates\nWe all know that research is key when beginning an A/B test. It can tell you when you're delivering the wrong marketing message, and it provides insight  into opportunities that could change your business.\nSo, I did some research.\nI wanted to know how people were interpreting and reacting to the landing page templates page on  Unbounce.com, so I added a Qualaroo survey widget to the page to ask a simple question:\nWhat do you think of our templates?\nThey look great: [ text box for extra info ]\nI don't understand how to use them: [ text box for extra info ]\nThey don't meet our needs: [ text box for extra info ]\nI ran this survey for about two months, and received 1,771 responses.\nAnalyzing these responses I spotted 3 consistently recurring questions from the freeform text entry fields that appeared when you submit a response.\nThe most common questions were:\nHow much do the templates cost?\nWhere can I download them?\nCan I use them in Wordpress?\nWuuuuut?! They exist inside the Unbounce product. You can't buy them, you can't download them, and you certainly can't use them with Wordpress!\nEpic fail followed by big opportunity.\nClearly visitors (a large portion of whom were arriving via organic search), were getting an entirely incorrect impression from this page. They didn't  understand the context within which you can use the templates.\nHow do you fix a broken experience like this?\nFirst, let's take a look at the original page:\nTemplates right?\nSure, but for what? In what? How much what?\nWhen someone arrives on your landing page, the first thing they do is to look around and subconsciously ask for help.\n\"I know why I came here, but I'm not sure where I am or what this is.\"\nYour job as a business, is to understand the mindset of your potential customers when they arrive at your landing page, and communicate appropriately.\nIn this instance, like I said, there are a large number of organic search visitors showing up who have absolutely zero context. They searched for \"landing  page templates\" and are thinking about templates and templates alone - not restrictions of where or how they can be used.\nTo answer the questions of these visitors, we created a two-step diagram to illustrate context of use:\nThe context of use we designed for this circumstance worked as follows:\nYou can view the template library in the app when you choose to build a new landing page.\nWhen you choose a template, you are taken to the page builder where you can customize and edit it.\nTest results\nPage A [Control] - No context of use\nThe conversion rate for people who see the templates page is 2.1%.\nPage B [Treatment] - With context of use diagram\nThe conversion rate of people who saw the new version of the page was 3%, a conversion rate lift of +43%.\nEPIC WIN! 43% Conversion Lift in New Account Trial Starts\nA really impressive result. But this type of number is thrown around all the time. What does it actually mean to a business? What is the impact on revenue?\nImpact on Revenue\nTo figure out the affect this win had on the business I took into account all of the relevant numbers.\nAdditional new trial starts (NTS) per month due to this test -- 120\nNTS over 12 months -- 1440\nAverage lifetime value of a customer -- $706\nIncremental impact on revenue based on a year of extra acquired customers:\n1,440 x $706 = $1,016,640\nThat's what happens when you help visitors to understand where they are and how the world works while they are there.\nChapter3: How to make friends forms and influence people\n\"I f**#ing hate forms! They ruin everything.\" -- Denis Suhopoljac\nThat was the reaction from our art director the last time we designed some landing page templates.\nUnfortunately, forms are a landing page staple, and because they represent your conversion goal, your ability to understand their nuances is the key to  success.\nYou should remember this statement:\nFriction is the barrier to entry (effort) that your form presents to your visitors. Friction falls into two categories and has one solution:\n3.1 Perceived Friction\nThis is the shock factor of suddenly being faced with a long form. The perception of having to fill out such a long form can be daunting and cause people  to change their mind. A solution to this can be to either shorten the form or split your form over more than one page.\n3.2 Actual Friction\nThis is the time and trouble it takes to actually *fill in* the form, and it can cause pretty serious abandonment issues if it's not considered. Things  that can slow down - or cause frustration during - the process of form completion include:\nToo many open-ended questions that people have to think about.\nDropdown menus that don't include a viable option for the visitor. An example of this is the commonly asked \"What industry is your business in?\".    If there isn't an answer available and you don't provide a way out (like an \"Other industry\" option) then frustration can occur.\nCaptcha security input fields. This is when you have to read strange looking words or letters and type in what you think they say in order to    proceed. Anyone not hate those?\n3.3 The solution: reducing friction with conversion lube\nYou probably thought that was a passing reference. Nope. Conversion lube is whatever you can give to your visitor to ease the transaction.\nMethod One: Ask the data for help\nOne approach to improvement is to analyze the results you get and adapt your form accordingly. When looking at your form data, ask yourself:\nAre a high percentage of dropdown results the first option in the list? If so, you should try to make the answers as short and clearly    distinguishable as possible. If people can easily/quickly read the option that applies to them without lots of hunting/scrolling, they will be more    inclined to select it.\nAre the responses to open-ended questions actually real answers? Or are they nonsense (such as \"asdfasdf\") designed to get through the form as    quickly as possible? If so, you should make the questions more direct and easier to answer. Examples would be: \"Tell us about your biggest    marketing problem\" (requires a short story as an answer) vs. \"What is the biggest barrier to your marketing success?\" (which could often be    answered in a few words like \"Not enough traffic.\").\nMethod Two: Apply some balance\n\"The prize\" is the incentive you offer up in exchange for personal data. Your goal is to balance the size of the prize with the amount of friction.\nThere are many incentives for a user to give up their personal information: Digital documents: Ebook/whitepaper/report, webinars, newsletters,  consultations for professional services, discount coupons, contest entries, free trials, product launch notifications.\nThe rule here is: Don't be greedy.\nOnly ask from your visitors what you would be willing to give up if the roles were reversed.\nOkay, be a little more greedy than that, but not much.\nFor instance, if you will be sending an automated newsletter to registrants, email or email/name are all that's needed. Whereas if you have a  product/service that requires a follow-up sales call, you would want more information to qualify the level of interest, and sometimes extra friction can  actually help to remove the looky loos from your funnel and improve lead quality. Like I said, it's a balancing act.\nWhen in doubt, don't get ahead of yourself. Remember that you should always start by asking for a kiss before trying to take it a step farther.\nI just got a sad feeling.\nI don't think I've done enough to make you fall in love with forms.\nYou should take a trundle over to this page where it'll all fall into place.\nHow to design the ultimate lead gen form\nNow we've covered some of the theory behind forms, you might be wondering exactly how to go about creating a rockstar form. We can do this by designing our  form as if it's the only thing we're allowed to put on our page.\nYour form consists of the following elements:\nA headline to introduce the reason for the form\nA description with bullets to highlight the benefit and contents of what you're giving away upon completion\nThe form with descriptive form fields (original label names and questions can capture attention)\nA Call-To-Action\nA closing urgency or context-enhancement statement\nBelow is a sketch of how a form designed using this method might look:\nHow was that? All loved up on forms? Not yet?\nMaybe we need some real examples. Below are some examples of lead gen landing pages (#withforms) that I  happen to like.\nThe short and sweet signup form\nThe ebook download form\nThe request a callback form floating over a guy's crotch\nThe super-long form with a happy guy at the end\n#formlove\nChapter4: The Mad Men pitch - writing copy that converts\nYour words are the first thing people pay attention to when the page loads, and the last thing they read before deciding whether or not they will complete  your conversion goal.\nYou would be a mad man (or woman) not to heed this next piece of advice.\n( Tweet this quote )\nOf course, that's an exaggeration; you should at least spend 5% of your time writing the body copy of your landing page, but that grandiose statement  should at least give you a sense of the relative importance of page elements when it comes to conversion rate optimization. For this reason, I'm going to  stick to these two elements (headline and CTA) and try to get you outta here before the bell rings.\nStart with your headline\nChances are you've had to go for a job interview at some point. Either that, or you're an entrepreneur begging to be heard by either potential customers or  potential investors.\nRegardless, the most and ONLY important thing when you start a conversation with someone, is to get your foot in the door.\nThat's what your headline does.\nIf you can write a headline interesting and useful enough to hold someone's attention, you've got your foot in the door of conversion. Now that you're in  the elevator, you have those precious extra seconds to communicate/pitch your idea.\nCopywriter Roberta Rosenberg offers this sage piece of advice:\n\" Your headline has one job and one job only. To get your visitors to continue engaging with your message, increase their desire for what you're offering,  and motivate a Call-To-Action click.\nThat's why when it comes to crafting effective landing page headlines, choose clarity over clever.\nClever calls attention to itself at the expense of the message.\nClarity smooths the way to conversion.\"\nI can verify the part about clarity over clever. Whenever we A/B test email subject lines, the clear version beats the funny or clever one. Stupidly, we  still carry on testing them ;)\nThere's an art to crafting an effective headline, but there are also some techniques and formulas you can lean on to help you get started.\nTo be very clear though. These are formulas for the construction of writing, not formulas for success - because there are no formulas for success. If there  were, I'd be sitting behind a diamond studded Macbook Pro, eating beef jerky and telling stories about eating beef jerky while being successful\nPoint being. Use these constructs to do exactly that. Construct your headline. The success depends entirely on your idea plus your will and enthusiasm.\nSo back to the writing:\nJoanna Wiebe from Copyhackers suggests these headline writing formulas:\nThe Only Way to [Do Something Desirable] Without [Doing Something Undesirable]\nThe Only Way to Turn Off the Lights Without Clapping or Getting Out of Bed\n[Do Something Hard] in [Period of Time] or [Promise]\nTune Your Piano in 15 Minutes or \"Piano Tuner App\" Is Free\n[Do Something Desirable] Like [an Expert] Without [Something Expected & Undesirable]\nLearn to Play Chess Like Bobby Fischer - Without Any of the Crazy!\nThey're not going to work for everything, but they will get you thinking.\nI often like to write the landing page value proposition as a sequence of 3 headlines split throughout the page, like a classic story arc of beginning,  middle, and end.\nThe main headline\n",

We have made it one of our core missions to battle patent trolls. To say were stunned by the Senates failure to act would be a gross understatement. As recently as last night, we had high hopes that a meaningful reform effort would move forward this week. Instead, we got the news today that the patent reform bill wont be moving forward. We view this as a massive failure of leadership.\nThis is so disappointing because curbing patent trolls is not a partisan issue. The House bill that passed last December received broad, bipartisan support. It passed the House with an overwhelming 325-vote majority, including 130 Democrats, and earned public support from President Obama and the Republican committee chair. We were relying heavily on the Senate to be an ally against these parasites that make America less competitive every day.\nInstead, this is the result of listening to a few select groups that live off of a broken system instead of listening to the thousands of individuals and companies across the entire American economy that actually produce value, jobs, and true innovation.\nWe dont forget that there were many Senators who fought on the right side of this battle. Senators Cornyn and Schumer in particular both took leadership roles in championing patent reform.\nThe Innovation Act represented the first truly comprehensive piece of patent litigation reform legislation, and todays move by the Senate can only be seen as a victory for the patent trolls that plague the industry with their vexatious lawsuits that amount to nothing more than extortion.\nPatent trolls and their lawsuits are a scourge on nearly every type of business. In our industry, companies large and small are in the crosshairs of patent trolls and have turned to the Senate for relief.\nWhile were saddened, we wont stop. Well continue to work within all of our communities to push for sorely needed patent litigation reform and to take the power away from patent trolls. We encourage all of our customers, partners and friends to join us in hopes that next year we can get Congress to act.\n",

            "content": "Leave a reply\nGo obtains much of its compilation speed from the Plan 9 compiler, of which it is a direct descendant. The Plan 9 toolchain deferred much of the work traditionally performed by a compiler to the linking stage and its performance was summarised in section 8 of this paper\nThe new compilers compile quickly, load slowly, and produce medium quality object code.\nBecause of the similar division of labour between Gos compiler and linker, linking is commonly more expensive that compilation. This leads to several problems\nLinking cannot benefit from the incremental compilation, each link pass starts afresheven if only a tiny partof program has changed.\nLinking speed is at least linear (often worse) with the number of packages being linked into the final executable larger programs link slower.\nWhile multiple commands may be linked in parallel, each individual link is single threaded as CPU speeds stall, or go backwards, favouring additional cores, linking gets slower in real terms.\nIt should be noted that while linking is considered slow in terms of the other parts of the Go toolchain, it remains much faster than linking a traditional C or C++ application.\nLinking speed has long been recognised as an issue by the Go developers and during the Go 1.3 development cycle the linker underwent major changes to improve its performance.\nWhat does the Go linker do ?\nTo understand the change, Russ Cox wrote in his proposal at the beginning of the cycle\nThe current linker performs two separable tasks.\nFirst, it translates an input stream of pseudo-instructions into executable code and data blocks, along with a list of relocations.\nSecond, it deletes dead code, merges whats left into a single image, resolves relocations, and generates a few whole-program data structures such as the runtime symbol table.\nIn a nutshell, the change has moved the first task of the linker, the pseudo instruction translation, from the linker into the compiler.\nWhat are pseudo instructions\nPrior to Go 1.3, the output of the compiler, the .a files in your $GOPATH/pkg directory was not directly executable machine code. Instead it was, as Russ describes, a stream of pseudo instructions, which, while not machine independent, it was also not directly executable.\nDuring the linking phase, the linker itself was responsible for turning this pseudo instruction stream into real machine code. Dealing with pseudo instructions during the compilation phase makes the compiler simpler to write.\nAn example of a pseudo instructions are the unifiedMOV instruction available to the compiler and assembler\nMOV R0, R1          // move the contents of R0 into R1 MOV $80000001, R0   // move the the constant 80000001  into R0 MOV R0, 0           // move the value into R0 into address 0\nOn a processor like ARM, when translated to machine code this becomes three separate operations. The first MOV R0, R1 is a simple move from one register to another and the final opcode is MOV.\nThe second form stores the large constant, 80000001 into R0. ARM processors cannot encode such a large constant directly into the instruction so the linker would store the constant at the end of the function and replace the MOV with a load from an address relative to the program counter into a scratch register (R11 is reserved for the linker) then move the value from R11 to R0.\nThe final form also needs help fromthe linker as ARM processors cannot use a constant as anaddress to store a value. The linker will arrange to load 0 into R11 then store the contents with an instruction like MOV R0, (R11)\nThe work required for X86 is similar, although the specific restrictions differ.\nThe results\nTo evaluate the performance improvements of the change to the linker Im going to compare building and linking two programs, the venerable godoc and the jujud server binary which depends on almost every line of code in the Juju repo.\nIn preparation I checked out copies of Go 1.2 and Go 1.3beta1 (this data was collected some time ago, but the changes in 1.3beta2 are unrelated to the linker).\ngodoc\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m3.239s user    0m3.307s sys     0m0.595s\nThe time to compile and link godoc from scratch on this machine with Go 1.2.1 was 3.2 seconds. Lets look at the time just to compile the main package and link godoc\n% touch ~/src/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc/play.go % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m1.578s user    0m1.434s sys     0m0.146s\nWith most of the compilation avoided, the total time drops to 1.5 seconds. Lets look at how the linker change in Go 1.3 affects the results.\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m3.193s user    0m3.441s sys     0m0.530s\nUnder Go 1.3beta1 the time to compile and link from scratch is roughly the same as Go 1.2.1. There is perhaps a hint that more work is being done in parallel. Lets compare the results from an incremental compilation.\n% touch ~/src/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc/play.go % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc real    0m0.996s user    0m0.881s sys     0m0.118s\nUnder Go 1.3beta1 the time to compile godocs main package and link has dropped from 1.5 seconds to just under a second. A saving of half a second, or 30% compared to the performance of Go 1.2.1.\njujud\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install  launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m8.247s user    0m18.110s sys     0m3.861s\nTime to compile and link jujud from scratch, roughly 220 packages at this time, was 8.2 seconds using Go 1.2.1. Lets look at the incremental performance.\n% touch ~/src/launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud/main.go % time /tmp/go1.2.1/bin/go install launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m3.139s user    0m2.831s sys     0m0.305s\nWhich shows the time to recompile the main package and link the executable is 3.2 seconds. You can also see that the process is almost entirely single threaded as the sum of user and sys is equal to the wall clock time, real.\nLets turn to Go 1.3beta1\n% rm -rf ~/pkg % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m8.107s user    0m20.533s sys     0m3.574s\nThe full rebuild times are comparable to the Go 1.2.1 results, possibly a hair faster. The real improvements show themselves in the incremental compilation scenario.\n% touch ~/src/launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud/main.go % time /tmp/go1.3beta1/bin/go install launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/jujud real    0m2.219s user    0m1.929s sys     0m0.290s\nUnder Go 1.3beta1 the time to recompile the main package and link has dropped from 3.2 seconds to 2.2 seconds, a saving of one second, again roughly 30%.\nIn conclusion\nIn my tests, the linker improvements coming in Go 1.3 deliver approximately a 30% reduction in link time. Depending on the size of your final executable this could be a small amount, or a significant amount of time.\nOverall the linking change has several important benefits:\nBecause its performed in the compile stage, the result is stored in your $GOPATH/pkg directory. Effectively the instruction selection pass is cached, whereas previously it was recomputed for each binary linked even if they shared many common packages.\nBecause more work is done in the compile stage, it is done in parallel if you have more than one CPU. If you have one CPU the end result is unchanged, the same amount of work is done, just at different phases, although you will benefit from point 1 regardless\nBecause more work is done in the compilation stage, less work is done in the linker, so the files passed to the linker are smaller and the work it has to do, which is effectively a mark, sweep and compact over all the symbols presented, is less.\nIn short, the 1.3 linker rocks.\n",

AND ITS FOUNDER, PALMER LUCKEY\nMay 21, 2014 (Rockville, MD) -- ZeniMax Media Inc. and its subsidiary, id Software LLC, filed suit today against Oculus VR, Inc. and its founder, Palmer Luckey, for illegally misappropriating ZeniMax trade secrets relating to virtual reality technology, and infringing ZeniMax copyrights and trademarks. ZeniMax is also asserting claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition against the defendants. The suit was filed in federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.\nThe suit arises from the defendants' unlawful exploitation of intellectual property, including trade secrets, copyrighted computer code, and technical know-how relating to virtual reality technology that was developed by ZeniMax after years of research and investment. ZeniMax provided this valuable intellectual property to defendants under a binding Non-Disclosure Agreement that specifies such intellectual property is owned exclusively by ZeniMax and cannot be used, disclosed, or transferred to third parties without ZeniMax's approval. ZeniMax's intellectual property has provided the fundamental technology driving the Oculus Rift since its inception. Nevertheless, the defendants refused all requests from ZeniMax for reasonable compensation and continue to use ZeniMax's intellectual property without authorization.\nAll efforts by ZeniMax to resolve this matter amicably have been unsuccessful. Oculus has recently issued a public statement remarkably claiming that \"ZeniMax has never contributed IP or technology to Oculus.\" Meanwhile, Luckey has held himself out to the public as the visionary developer of virtual reality technology, when in fact the key technology Luckey used to establish Oculus was developed by ZeniMax.\n\"Intellectual property forms the foundation of our business,\" said Robert Altman, Chairman & CEO of ZeniMax. \"We cannot ignore the unlawful exploitation of intellectual property that we develop and own, nor will we allow misappropriation and infringement to go unaddressed.\"\n\"ZeniMax and id Software take their intellectual property rights seriously,\" said P. Anthony Sammi, a Partner of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP which represents ZeniMax and id in this matter. \"We now look to the federal courts and will pursue all appropriate measures available under the law to rectify defendants' egregious conduct,\" he added.\n 2014 ZENIMAX MEDIA INC.

            "content": "\nA Brief Note on the Economic History of Space Exploration in America\nAlexander MacDonald alexander.c.macdonald@nasa.govFor the majority of its history, space exploration in America has been funded privately. The trend of wealthy individuals, such as Paul Allen, Jeff Bezos, Robert Bigelow, and Elon Musk, devoting some of their resources to the exploration of space is not an emerging one, it is the long-run, dominant trend which is now\nre-\nemerging. This note provides a brief synopsis of the evidence and argument for these statements. For hundreds of years prior to the Space Age, we explored space through the telescopes of ground-based astronomical observatories. If we consider discoveries made through observations by robotic spacecraft to be space exploration, then we should consider discoveries made through ground-based astronomical observatories to be space exploration as well. In both cases the experience of the human observer is fundamentally the same  that of having vision extended into space through advanced technology. By using a consistent metric to compare the cost of that technology, whether spacecraft or telescope, we can examine the economic history of space exploration in America as a continuum extending from the mid-19\nth\ncentury to the present day and identity long-run trends in funding. There are a number of ways to convert historical costs into present day equivalent values. The most commonly used method is adjustment for inflation. This method calculates current equivalent values of historical costs according to the change in the price of basic consumer goods, like bread and clothing, over the intervening time. If we are interested in the share of total resources that a given project of space exploration represents, however, we need to adjust according to the change in the size of the American economy. To do this, we take the then-year expenditure of a given project and divide it by the estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the U.S. economy for that year. To convert this ratio into an equivalent present day value, the percentage is multiplied by the current GDP. The result is the equivalent GDP ratio value of space exploration expenditures, and if we are interested in how the American economy has allocated its resources towards space exploration over time, this is the appropriate metric to examine.\n\nSpace Exploration Projects in the 19\nth\n(Source: MacDonald, A.,\nThe Remote Space Age: An Economic History of Space Exploration from Galileo to Gagarin\nforthcoming doctoral dissertation at the University of Oxford; conversions using GDP time series from Johnston, L.D., and Williamson, S.H., \"The Annual Real and Nominal GDP for the United States, 1790 - Present\" MeasuringWorth, 2008) Examining the equivalent GDP ratio value of early American observatories makes it clear that space exploration has been funded at economically significant levels for over 150 years. The table above provides the 2008 GDP ratio equivalent values for a number of American observatories and space exploration projects in the 19\nth\nand early 20\nth\ncenturies. Projects at relative scales equivalent to $100 million to $1 billion were relatively common. It is worth emphasizing that the modern equivalent values calculated here should be taken only to indicate the order of magnitude of expenditure, given that other appropriate equivalent resource share values can be calculated; for example, rather than scaling the expenditure as a share of the total resources of the U.S. economy, the expenditure can be scaled as a share of the resources of the individuals who undertook the projects. James Lick was the richest man in California and the Lick Observatory expenditure represented 17.5% of his entire estate. The equivalent share of the wealth of the richest man in California today, Larry Ellison, is $3.9 billion dollars, approximately four times higher than the GDP equivalent share.\nProject Year Cost 2008 GDP Ratio Equivalent Value University of North Carolina Observatory 1831 $6,430\n1\n$89,000,000 Williams College Observatory 1836 $6,100\n2\nWest Point Academy Observatory 1842 $5,000\n3\n$45,000,000 U.S. Naval Observatory 1842 $25,000\n4\n",

Washington, D.C. and 21    states have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum.\nMcDonald's spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said the company and its    franchisees were monitoring the minimum wage debate. \"$15 is    unrealistic, but we know that the minimum wage will increase over time,\"    she said.\n\"It's time for the McDonald's Corporation ... to stop pretending that it    can't boost pay for the people who make and serve their food,\" said    Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union    (SEIU), who was among those arrested at the protest in Oak Brook, Illinois.    Organisers said 2,000 people turned out for the rally.\nA recent report from New York think tank Demos found that the CEO-to-worker    compensation ratio for the fast food industry was more than 1,000-to-1 in    2013.\nThus far, public pension fund managers from New York City, Connecticut and the    California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) have said they plan    to vote against the McDonald's executive pay advisory measure at the    company's annual meeting on Thursday.\nOfficials of the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and    the Florida State Board of Administration said they would vote in support of    the measure.\nChipotle Mexican Grill shareholders on May 15 voted overwhelmingly against an    advisory pay proposal from the burrito seller, which paid its co-CEOs nearly    $50 million (29.59) last year.\n\n",

Traders also cheered news of Netflix's plans to make a deeper foray into Europe, sending the Internet video service's shares up 5 percent.\nInvestors got a closer look at discussions held by the Federal Reserve's policymakers in their most recent meeting last month. Wall Street's reaction was muted, however, and the market kept on the upward trajectory it set upon early on.\nU.S. index futures rose before the opening of regular stock trading. The market opened higher and stayed in positive territory throughout the day.\nMajor indexes have finished higher three of the last four trading days.\n\"Since there was no real solid news to continue into a two-day sell-off, we're getting a little bit of a bounce today,\" said Joe Peta, a managing director of Novus.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 15.20 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,888.03. The index is up 2.2 percent for the year.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 158.75 points, or nearly 1 percent, to end at 16,533.06.

The Russell 2000 index rose 5.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,103.63.\nBond prices fell, driving the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note up to 2.54 percent from 2.51 percent late Tuesday.\nAll 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500 rose, led by consumer discretionary and energy stocks.\nThe stock market has fluctuated between gains and losses on an almost daily basis as investors try to get a better handle on the trajectory of the economy following a weak start to the year.\nThat pattern continued even after the S&P 500 hit a high early last week.\nIn all, the market has changed course from one day to another nearly 60 percent of the time so far this year, something not seen since 2008 during the financial crisis, Peta said.\n\"It is a schizophrenic market that doesn't seem to have much of a memory from one day to the next,\" he said.\nThe Fed meeting minutes released Wednesday shed little new light on a key question for many investors: When will the Fed start raising interest rates?\nFed officials discussed how to unwind the support the central bank has given the economy once they decide to begin raising the Fed's key short-term rate. Because the economy is still recovering, most analysts don't think the Fed will start raising rates before the second half of 2015.\nThe market got a more detailed look at corporate America with a new batch of company earnings.\nTiffany said its earnings spiked 50 percent in the first quarter as worldwide sales jumped by double digits and the company raised its prices. The results beat analysts' expectations and the jeweler raised its earnings forecast for the year. Tiffany's stock jumped $8.07, or 9.1 percent, to $96.30.\n\"Retail is very fickle right now, but some sectors are doing well, like luxury,\" said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management.\nNetflix shares rose $18.93, or 5.1 percent, to $390.60 after the company said it will expand into Germany, France and four other European countries later this year.\nOnline payments system provider Qiwi vaulted 20.7 percent after the company raised both its profit and revenue outlook for 2014 after a strong first quarter. The stock rose $7.21 to $42.12.\nNot all stocks had such a good day.\nPetSmart dropped $5.17, or 8.3 percent, to $57.02 after the pet store chain reported disappointing revenue for the first quarter and slashed its earnings outlook for the current quarter and year.\nTrading volume was lighter than usual Wednesday, something that's likely to continue this week as the Memorial Day weekend nears.\nInvestors will get a fresh batch of data on housing and the economy on Thursday, as well as earnings from Hewlett-Packard, Best Buy and Sears, among others.\nWant unlimited access to seattletimes.com?

During the past fiscal year, CREDIT SUISSE GROUP increased its bottom line by earning $1.30 versus $0.89 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.53 versus $1.30).\nRegardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 5.1%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 3.3%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share.\nNet operating cash flow has significantly decreased to -$3,698.89 million or 118.25% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the industry average, the firm's growth is significantly lower.\nThe company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Capital Markets industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 253.0% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $318.19 million to -$486.90 million.\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: CS Ratings Report\n",

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange May 16, 2014.\nCredit: Reuters/Brendan McDermid\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the yen for the first time in six sessions on Wednesday as Federal Reserve minutes suggested the U.S. central bank will keep reducing its stimulus plan, while world stock markets bounced back from the previous day's drop.\nThe minutes of the April session also showed Fed staff discussed approaches to raising short-term interest rates, but that it was not a sign rate hikes would come any time soon.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen said in March the U.S. central bank could raise rates six months after its bond-buying program ended.\nSome analysts said the minutes suggested that the Fed's plan to reduce of its stimulus program remained in place, despite comments from some Fed participants that it is too early to confirm whether or not the U.S. economy is moving to sustained above-trend growth.\n\"The baseline scenario is still for slow, but steady improvement; there is no inflation risk and the Fed will keep tapering,\" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York.\nThe dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen at 101.45. It earlier tumbled to its lowest in more than three months at 100.80 yen, hurt by optimistic comments about the economy from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who gave no hint of further monetary easing in the near term.\nThe dollar also rose against the euro.\nMSCI's all-world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 45 nations, gained 0.5 percent, while European shares .FTEU3 ended up 0.6 percent.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 158.75 points, or 0.97 percent, to end at 16,533.06, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 15.2 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,888.03 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 34.65 points, or 0.85 percent, to 4,131.54.\nStocks added to gains following the minutes, thought they were strongly higher before the release, rebounding after a sell-off on Tuesday. It was the S&P 500's third advance in the past four sessions.\n\"The minutes are in line with what investors are thinking, which is that we see a rebound in growth, but it is not to a point where the economy looks overly strong,\" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in New York.\nIn the bond market, U.S. 10-year Treasuries pared price losses after the release of the minutes.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last down 7/32 in price to yield 2.536 percent, from 2.509 percent late Tuesday.\nMuch of the price weakness in the long end of the Treasuries market had taken place in the run-up to the minutes. Traders said that profit-taking after last week's rally in 10-year notes and 30-year bonds had also weakened prices on those securities.\nOIL RISES, GOLD FALLS\nGold stayed lower as the dollar climbed after the Fed minutes. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,290.84 an ounce.\nOil prices rose on the day, supported by an industry report showing U.S. crude inventories had unexpectedly fallen last week and by persistent disruption to Libya's output amid renewed fighting.\nU.S. crude rose $1.70 to settle at $104.07, while Brent settled at $110.55, up 86 cents.\n(Additional reporting Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Angela Moon in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish , Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)\nTweet this\n",

Analysts had expected a fall of 1.1 percent.\nTarget shares were flat at midday, reflecting lingering concerns about the company's prospects as it resorts to discounts to win back customers and faces the daunting task of getting its business in Canada on track.\n\"It could have been worse is the general refrain...\", said David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets. \"...It was not the disaster that was feared.\"\nTarget said traffic was \"dramatically better\" in the first quarter compared with late fourth-quarter trends.\nEven so, U.S. store traffic fell more than 2 percent in the quarter and total sales rose just 2.1 percent to $17.05 billion, only slightly better than analysts had expected.\nBrian Yarbrough, an analyst at investment firm Edward Jones, said he expected discounting - which hurt gross margins by more than a percentage point in the quarter - to continue until year-end when he expects traffic to start growing again.\nTraffic improved in February and March despite the harsh weather that other retailers have blamed for weak sales, interim Chief Executive John Mulligan said on a call with reporters.\nMulligan, the company's chief financial officer, replaced Gregg Steinhafel, who was ousted earlier in May after a data breach during the holiday shopping season resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers.\nSteinhafel had also overseen Target's bungled push into Canada, where the company lost almost $1 billion last year after opening 124 stores in an unprecedented expansion that caused supply chain and other operational problems.\nTarget fired the head of its Canada operations, Tony Fisher, on Tuesday and replaced him with company veteran Mark Schindele.\n\"We are not where we need to be (in Canada),\" Mulligan said.\nThe company lowered its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $3.60-$3.90 per share from $3.85-$4.15 to account for increased discounting and investments in e-commerce.\nAnalysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTarget's net income fell 16 percent to $418 million in the quarter ended May 3 even after benefiting from a year-earlier comparison that included a huge debt retirement charge related to the sale of the company's credit card operations.\nExcluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share, missing the average estimate by 1 cent.\nTarget's shares were up 0.4 percent at $56.62 at midday.\n(Editing by Ted Kerr)\nsns-rt-us-target-results-20140521\nWe've upgraded our reader commenting system.

            "content": "A photo of Russell Bucklew from February 2014 provided by the Missouri Department of Corrections. (AP)\nUpdate:\nThe Supreme Court granted the stay of execution on Wednesday night, halting the execution with a three-sentence order that sent it back to lower courts. There was no explanation given, and the justices left it to the lower courts to determine if an evidentiary hearing will be needed.\nCheryl Pilate, an attorney for Bucklew, said in a statement that she is extremely pleased and relieved that the stay was granted.\nTodays stay of execution will give the lower federal courts time to consider Mr. Bucklews claim that his execution would violate his rights under the Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, Pilate said.\nEarlier:\nA day after a series of appeals, court rulings and judicial reversals halted an execution in Missouri, the condemned inmates fate remained in limbo as all eyes turned to the Supreme Court for a final decision.\nRussell Bucklew, 46, was sentenced to death nearly two decades ago for shooting and killing a man in 1996 before going on to beat, rape and abduct an ex-girlfriend. Missouri was prepared to execute him at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday in what would have been the countrys first execution since a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma last month.That episode saw Clayton Lockett, a convicted killer, writhe and grimace on the gurney; his vein had collapsed , so the execution was called off, but he died from a heart attack shortly thereafter.\nBut following a seesawing series of court announcements during several hours Tuesday night, Bucklews execution was ultimately halted  for the time being.\nHis attorneys had asked the courts for a stay of execution owing to a medical condition of Bucklews that they said causes weak blood vessels to grow in his face and neck, causing growths that obstruct his airway. They had filed a request for a stay with a U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, which denied the request Monday. They also filed appeals requesting a stay with the U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday.\nOn Tuesday, several hours before Bucklew was scheduled to die , a federal appeals court panel halted the execution .The panel from theU.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in Kansas City granted the 60-day stay , writing thatundisputed medical evidence submitted by his attorneys made it clear that Bucklew would likely endure unnecessary pain and suffering beyond the constitutionally permissible amount inherent in all executions.\nHowever, a few hours later, the full appeals court ruled that the execution could still proceed. The court offered little explanation in writing that the stay of execution granted by the panel is vacated.\nA short time after that, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. halted the execution again , this time writing in an order that the execution would be stayed pending further order from Alito or the full court.\nMissouri Attorney General Chris Koster issued a statement late Tuesday night , saying that the full Supreme Court would consider the issue Wednesday.The execution warrant allowing the state to kill Bucklew remainsvalid until 12 a.m. Thursday, Koster said. As a result, the courts action or inaction, if the court doesnt make a decision during that window will determine whether the state carries out its fifth lethal injection of the year Wednesday.\nBucklews attorneys filed an application for a stay with the Supreme Court that cited the untreatable nature of Bucklews condition.Lethal injection, as recent executions have demonstrated, is not a one-size-fits all procedure, the application says. What may be deemed constitutional for one prisoner may be gravely risky and in fact torturous for another.\nMissouri calls Bucklews objections vague and general.\nBucklew has known about his medical condition for decades, and has known for six years that a motion to set his execution date had been sustained, according to the states filing. He cannot now ask for a stay because testing might generate some proposal for changes in the way he is to be executed.\nCheryl Pilate, one of Bucklews attorneys, described the wait as pretty nerve-wracking in a telephone interview Wednesday.\nIts agonizing, the uncertainty is agonizing,Pilate said from her office in downtown Kansas City. Theres no answer, really, I can give to my client if he wants to know whats going to happen. I can merely try to be supportive during an agonizing and almost unimaginable situation.\nPilate said she had spoken with Bucklew several times and added that his medical condition is aggravated by stress. When she spoke with him on Wednesday, she said his breathing and speaking sounded labored.\nThey have upped his medications for pain and the anxiety associated with it, she said. Its just a great deal of uncertainty. No one knows what is going to happen. We try to maintain a hopeful outlook.\nThe situation is also stressful for his attorneys, who have operated at hyperspeed as they have turned around and file pleadings as fast as they can type them, she said.\nEveryones exhausted, because weve been working as close to around the clock as our bodies will allow, Pilate said. We tried to get a little bit of rest at least last night because we knew today might be a long day as well.\nBucklew has said that the botch in Oklahoma has him worried about what could happen if his execution goes awry.\nIm sick about it not working on me. Im afraid that its going to turn me into a vegetable, that Id be brain dead, Bucklew told the Guardian this month. You saw what happened down in Oklahoma. Im the next guy up  am I gonna get all screwed up here? Are they gonna screw it up?\nIf Bucklews execution is halted, it will be the third execution called off in less than a month. Charles Warner was set to be executed in Oklahoma immediately following the botched execution, but when that lethal injection went awry, his execution was postponed so the state can review what happened and its protocols; the Oklahoma attorney general has agreed to delay his execution until at least November. An execution in Texas, scheduled to take place last week , was halted at the last minute because the inmate was deemed to have an intellectual disability.\nDeborah W. Deno, a Fordham University professor and a death penalty expert, said it seemed like the botch in Oklahoma has made courts more tentative when it comes to approving executions.\nIt seems like Oklahoma has legally thrown everyone through a loop, she said. It seems to have an effect. It seems to make courts take everything with a greater caution.\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) denied Bucklews clemency request Tuesday, saying in a statement that Bucklews heinous crimes warranted the death penalty.\nThe state, which switched to carrying out executions using an injection of the drug pentobarbital, has executed four people so far this year. That is as many executions as it carried out between 2006 and 2013.\nAttorneys for Bucklew have also criticized the secrecy surrounding the states lethal injection procedures.Missouris refusal to reveal where it obtains the drugs isthe subject of a lawsuit filed last week by several news organizations.The Associated Press, the Guardian and three other media organizations sued the Missouri Department of Corrections to try and force the state to reveal where it is obtaining the drugs for lethal injections.\n",

VPC\nBy Brett Molina and Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY 9:28 p.m. EDT May 21, 2014\nA view of eBay headquarters in San Jose, Calif.\n(Photo: Ben Margot, AP)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nOnline marketplace eBay says it will urge users to change their passwords following a \"cyberattack\" on a database with encrypted passwords and non-financial data.\nThe database includes information such as customers' names, encrypted passwords, email and physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. As of the end of their first quarter, the company has 145 million active buyers.\n\"It's substantial,\" says Simon Eappariello, senior vice president of engineering at iBoss Network Security. \"If they're going to contact all of their users to change their passwords, that's a major breach in anyone's book. That's a lot of data.\"\nHackers: Experts dissect the eBay privacy breach\n\"This is the new normal,\" said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with Gartner, a technology research company based in Stamford, Conn.\n\"It's part of a trend where criminals are going after credentials,\" she said. \"We've seen a big rise in the use of stolen passwords at banks. The criminals are cycling through all these passwords they've stolen, trying to use them,\" she said.\nAt some point, \"it could become pretty ominous. All this data's getting stolenwe have to assume it's eventually going to be used,\" said Litan. \"The criminals are building big data stores with as much financial information as they can get. Who knows what they're doing with all of it?\nThe Dark Web: Untangling cybercrime\nIn a statement released Wednesday, eBay says it has not found evidence of unauthorized activity or access to financial information, based on \"extensive\" tests. The company says financial data was not affected, pointing out credit card information is encrypted and stored separately from this database.\n\"We know our customers trust us with their information, and we take seriously our commitment to maintaining a safe, secure and trusted global marketplace,\" a company statement said.\nEBay is encouraging people who used the same password on other sites to change those credentials as well.\nThe company says it has seen no proof of unauthorized access to PayPal, its online payment service. \"PayPal data is stored separately on a secure network, and all PayPal financial information is encrypted,\" says the company.\nThe criminal groups behind these massive data breaches are typically out of Eastern Europe, Litan said. \"They're very well organized. They've got black markets set up to sell this stolen merchandise. They distribute it around the world. And the data is sold a lot faster than it used to be.\"\nWhile eBay has downplayed the breach because it didn't include financial information, the loss of an unknown number of passwords has the potential to compromise all websites, not just eBay, security experts say. That's because many consumers use the same password on multiple sites.\n\"The attackers will quickly take over accounts across the web wherever a user reused their username and password on another site,\" said Michael Coates, director of product security at Shape Security in Mountain View, Calif.\nEBay also was using a more easily-cracked method for protecting the passwords it kept on file. There are two commonly used ways to secure passwords, encryption and hashing. EBay was using encryption, which is the more easily broken, said Coates.\n\"Encryption allows eBay, or anyone who access the decryption key, to decrypt and see your actual password. Password hashing allows eBay to check if the password you enter is correct or not, but doesn't allow eBay (or hackers) to get the plaintext of your actual password,\" he said.\nThe compromise, which happened between late February and early March, resulted from a cyberattack targeting a small group of employee log-in credentials. Emails will go out to users today to request changes to their passwords. The company says they will also employ additional security measures.\nForrester analyst Tyler Shields says it's concerning that it took eBay until earlier this month to uncover the breach. \"From late February and March to just about two weeks ago is a LOT of time for an attacker to be roaming around your network and systems.\"\nTrey Ford, security strategist with Rapid7, says attackers could use information taken from the database to pose as legitimate company representatives.\n\"Users should be wary of anyone contacting them claiming to be eBay or any other company for that matter,\" says Ford. \"Expect an uptick in phishing, do not click links in email, or discuss anything over the phone.\"\nThe eBay breach is the latest in a series of attacks targeting customer data. Earlier this month, Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel stepped down months after hackers swiped financial information on 40 million customers. In April, AOL confirmed its email service had been hacked, with users complaining their accounts were sending spam to contacts.\nEric Chiu, president and co-founder of security firm HyTrust, says this cyberattack is more proof high-profile breaches like eBay and Target are occurring more frequently. \"This is another wakeup call that organizations need to take an 'inside-out' approach to security and assume the bad guy is already on their network.\"\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gRgxSH\nUSA NOW\nEBay urges new passwords after massive breach | USA NOW\nMay 21, 2014\n",

(AP)  A grandmother arrived at a dilapidated home on a busy Southern California street to visit her daughter and three grandchildren, only to find the girls' small, blood-covered bodies neatly arranged on a bed.\nNeighbors and authorities say the woman frantically ran outside, throwing a bloody knife to the ground and told the girls' father, who was working on a car, that his wife had gone crazy and killed all the kids. Then she called 911.\n\"'Oh my God, oh my God,'\" he screamed after learning his daughters were dead, said next-door neighbor Veronica Ruiz, who watched the aftermath unfold.\nAuthorities said 30-year-old Carol Coronado remained hospitalized in stable condition Wednesday after being taken from the grisly scene Tuesday afternoon covered in blood and naked under a blanket, with multiple self-inflicted stab and slice wounds.\nShe's expected to be arrested on suspicion of murder in the death of her daughters, who were 2 years, 16 months and 2 months old, after she is released from the hospital, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Coleman said.\n\"The babies were on the bed,\" Coleman said. \"And not in a haphazard fashion, they were placed on the bed, so how and where they were killed, we're going to have to figure that out.\"\nInvestigators were reviewing Coronado's medical records and her service in the military. She joined the Army after high school but only spent a few months in the service before being released due to an injury, Coleman said.\nMultiple knives were taken from the scene, including the knife the grandmother threw on the ground, which was believed to be the one used to stab the girls to death.\nAuthorities said the grandmother, whose name was not released, had come to the home near Torrance to visit after receiving a call from her daughter. Coleman said detectives believe the stabbings likely occurred just before the grandmother arrived.\nColeman said investigators don't believe there were prior calls for deputies to visit the home, but he stressed that it was still early in the investigation.\nOn Wednesday, the home in the working class neighborhood was quiet except for reporters and photographers who crowded the fenced-off area to get a look at a yard piled high with junk and a small residence that appeared to be a converted garage or shed, with a red and green \"Seasons Greetings\" sign hanging from it.\nRuiz's son, 15-year-old Jesus Renteria, said the grandmother told him and his mother that Coronado was overwhelmed.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gReZIq\nUSA NOW\nEBay urges new passwords after massive breach | USA NOW\nMay 21, 2014\n",

Following a nearly decade-long campaign to gain protection for the Organ Mountains in southern New Mexico, the White House says President Obama will designate the area a national monument.\nCAPTION\nBy Associated Press,\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  President Barack Obama on Wednesday declared almost a half-million acres of rugged desert terrain along the U.S.-Mexico border as a national monument, marking the largest swath of land to be set aside for that purpose since he took office.\nPhotos: Hero cat throws first pitch\nWhile praised by environmentalists, the move is generating criticism from some lawmakers in the West and local law enforcement agents who see Obamas use of power as a threat to security in a region where the influence of Mexican drug cartels, human smuggling and illegal immigration are all apparent.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and others also complained that the designation of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in southern New Mexico is the latest example of Obama taking unilateral action to sidestep Congress.\nOnce again, the president has chosen to bypass the legislative branch  and, in this case, do so in a manner that adds yet another challenge in our ongoing efforts to secure our southern border, Boehner said. At a time of continued cartel violence in Mexico, we should not be putting any additional restraints on efforts to protect our borders.\nOfficials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the designation will not limit their ability to perform the agencys mission along the border.\nThe campaign by environmentalists, hunters and tourism officials to gain wilderness protection for the Organ Mountains and Desert Peaks has dragged on for a decade, with numerous versions introduced by the states delegation over the years.\nNew Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, both Democrats, had most recently proposed legislation to protect the region, which includes hunting areas and features rock outcroppings, petroglyphs, ancient lava flows and sites such as Billy the Kids Outlaw Rock and Geronimos Cave.\nAfter hosting a series of public meetings, the senators amended their proposal to include a buffer zone for law enforcement. With Wednesdays proclamation, critics say there are no provisions to allow for local law enforcement to patrol the area.\nDona Ana County Sheriff Todd Garrison recalled the times his deputies and federal agents were shot at as they pursued suspected drug smugglers through the area. He also talked about stolen cars that were used to ferry drugs through the desert and past border patrol checkpoints.\nIf we have no ability to patrol that area, crime is going to increase. It will be akin to the Organ Pipe National Monument in Arizona. I wonder how many years it will be before we have to post signs that say Enter at your own risk, Garrison said.\nU.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, was among those who sent letters to Obama asking him to refrain from establishing the monument. Bishop said letting the legislation work its way through Congress would have allowed for border security concerns to be addressed.\nHis decision stands, and now we have to go back in and try and fix it. That is just a backward way of trying to have good government, Bishop said. Originally the Antiquities Act was used to try and preserve stuff. These recent presidents are abusing the process to make a political statement, not to save anything.\nObama vowed during Wednesdays signing ceremony to make more proclamations using his executive power under the Antiquities Act to protect federal lands.\nRepublican Rep. Steve Pearce, whose congressional district covers the region, had proposed a designation for just 55,000 acres. He said years of work went in to developing a plan that would be acceptable to ranchers, business owners, sportsmen and conservationists. He said Obama ignored that with the stroke of a pen.\nUdall and Heinrich said Wednesday they will continue their legislative push to establish wilderness areas within the new monument and to release the restrictions that come along with such areas to give Border Patrol agents more flexibility.\nSupporters of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks monument say setting aside the area could generate $7.4 million in economic activity from visitors and business opportunities. They say the designation could also lead to more federal funding and staffing for the Bureau of Land Management and the Border Patrol to enforce rules throughout the area.\nWhen you dont have enough management and staff thats always a problem, but also its hard to control when the public doesnt value the resources, said Oscar Simpson with Backcountry Horsemen of New Mexico, one of the groups supporting the monument. Its all an education process. Its making people understand these are really unique things and you need to protect them.\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania said Wednesday that he would not appeal a judge's ruling striking down the state's ban on same-sex marriage. With the decision, Pennsylvania became the 19th state, along with the District of Columbia, where same-sex couples are able to marry.\n2 Marriage ban: Four gay couples are suing Montana over its constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. That leaves North Dakota and South Dakota as the only two states with gay marriage bans and no lawsuits seeking to overturn them. The Montana lawsuit was being filed Wednesday in federal court in Great Falls, with help from the Montana ACLU . It lists as plaintiffs four Montana couples who are either unmarried or were married outside the state.\n3 Air passengers' rights: Passengers love the idea, but airlines hate it. The government wants to require that travelers be told up-front about basic services that aren't included in the price of a ticket and how much extra they'll cost. The Transportation Department proposed Wednesday that passengers be provided detailed information on fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, advance seat assignments and carry-on bags. The rules would apply whether passengers bought tickets on the phone, in person or online - and not just from airline websites. Airlines that want their tickets to remain available through travel agents and online ticketing services would have to provide them information on fees for basic services, too, something most have been reluctant to do.\n4 Bus crash: A bus rolling through a remote stretch of desert struck a load of metal pipes scattered across a dark California highway Wednesday, then slid down an embankment and overturned in an accident that killed four passengers and seriously injured at least seven others. Only a minute or two before the collision, the pipes had tumbled from a flatbed truck that jackknifed after drifting into the dirt median on Interstate 10, the main road linking Southern California and Arizona, the California Highway Patrol said. Wednesday's crash occurred around 2:15 a.m. just west of Blythe, near the Arizona border.\n5 California parks director: California's state parks director abruptly announced his retirement Wednesday, just 19 months after he took control of the department that had been rocked by years of fiscal mismanagement. Anthony Jackson , a retired Marine Corps major general, said in a statement that his tenure \"has been a challenging, but ultimately fulfilling\" one. Jackson took office in November 2012 after the previous director resigned following disclosures that the department kept $54 million hidden in two special funds for more than a decade, even as budget cuts threatened to close 70 of nearly 280 state parks.\n6 Arizona wildfires: Hundreds of firefighters poured into Arizona on Wednesday to battle a wind-whipped wildfire in a canyon near Sedona that sent up choking plumes of smoke and scuttled Memorial Day weekend plans in the popular hiking and camping area. Authorities warned about 3,200 residents between Sedona and Flagstaff that they need to be ready to evacuate if the fire makes another advance. The blaze earlier Wednesday doubled in size to 1 1/3 square miles and could grow by nightfall to 2,000 acres, or about 3 square miles.\n",

            "content": "Clinton allies pressured Dems on Benghazi\n\n\nIf Clinton testifies, it will almost certainly be one of the blockbuster moments for the panel. | AP Photo\nClose\nBy JAKE SHERMAN and ANNA PALMER | 5/21/14 8:02 PM EDT\nHillary Clintons world was so worried about a Republican investigation of the Benghazi attacks, they sent a message to House Democrats: We need backup.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) publicly considered boycotting the panel, an idea that Clinton supporters feared would leave the potential 2016 candidate exposed to the enemy fire of House Republicans.\nreset\nPelosi names Dems to panel\nSo Clinton emissaries launched a back channel campaign, contacting several House Democratic lawmakers and aides to say theyd prefer Democrats participate, according to sources familiar with the conversations. Pelosis staff said they have not heard from Clintons camp.\n( Also on POLITICO: Pelosi picks Dems for panel )\nOn Wednesday, Pelosi appointed five Democrats to the committee, giving Democrats another crucial mission in the months ahead of what was already a tough election year: act as Clintons first line of defense.\nRepublicans are making it clear they plan to use the power of the Benghazi Select Committee to continue to politicize the tragedy that occurred in Benghazi, which is exactly why Democratic participation in the committee is vital, a Democrat close to Clinton world said. Inevitably, witnesses ranging from Secretary Clinton to Secretary [John] Kerry will be subpoenaed to testify, and the Democrats appointed to the committee will help restore a level of sanity to the hearings, which would otherwise exist solely as a political witch hunt.\nAs Republicans continue their high-profile probe into the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Clinton is center stage. Over the next few months, Republicans on the committee will work to build a case against her, and they will attempt to haul her to Capitol Hill to testify.\n( Also on POLITICO: House GOP gears up on Benghazi )\nClinton and her allies know from experience the kind of damage an emboldened Republican House committee can inflict.\nIf Clinton testifies, it will almost certainly be one of the blockbuster moments for the committee and an important prelude as she considers a second run for the White House.\nSome Democrats are already worried that they have been too slow to prepare for the expected partisan battles on Benghazi. Republicans have been teeing up for months.\nPelosi asked some Democratic lawmakers to be on the panel Wednesday and it is unclear exactly how they will handle staffing matters. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) announced last week that he was bringing on lobbyist Phil Kiko to be the majority staff director for the committee. Lawmakers in both parties are slated to huddle Thursday to discuss how they will proceed.\n( PHOTOS: Clintons best Benghazi hearing lines )\nPelosi told reporters Wednesday that she doesnt think Clinton or Kerry needs the help of House Democrats, but that she moved to appoint members to the panel for all the other people whom Republicans might call.\nAnd when it was not guaranteed that we would have access to who they were in sufficient time in advance to prepare  that really argued in favor of saying lets not worry again about the Hillary Clintons and the John Kerrys, they can fend for themselves, but lets make sure there is not an exploitation of information because we did not have access to these other people that were called, the California Democrat said.\nPelosi picked Reps. Linda Sanchez and Adam Schiff of California, Adam Smith of Washington state and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois to fill the panel. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, will serve as ranking member.\nOf course, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his Republican leadership team are keenly aware of the select committee becoming a witch hunt, focused solely on bruising and bloodying a potential presidential candidate. Furthermore, Boehner and his aides have made it clear that the committee members must become conversant in the facts of the Benghazi attacks before calling witnesses. One slip-up, Republicans say, could undermine their entire effort.\nGowdy, whom Boehner entrusted with the probe, said in an interview that Pelosi made great picks.\nThe ones that I know well are very thoughtful and very smart, and I have a great working relationship with them, Gowdy said.\nThe South Carolina Republican declined to address how hell handle any questioning of Clinton. He said that he believes closed depositions  not open hearings  are the best way to extract information from witnesses. Open hearings are best to have the public decide between two divergent views of the same situation, he said. But Gowdy declined to say whether Clinton will be deposed, cross-examined in a public hearing  or both.\nIm not foreclosing any avenue of information, he said.\nAsked whether Clinton will he brought to Capitol Hill, Gowdy said, without specific reference to any individual, if someone has knowledge surrounding a relevant fact, I would expect the committee to talk to them.\nYoure a smart guy, do you think she has knowledge surrounding any relevant facts? Gowdy said.\nDemocrats are hoping that Republicans turn this into a circus  and their affinity for bashing Clinton becomes clear.\nThe creation of this committee is solely for propaganda, for politics, said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), a veteran of congressional oversight who lobbied Pelosi to seat Democrats on the panel. Its rather cheap, in my opinion, because after all the other committees held hearings and looked at the issue, and there was nothing there. But Republicans are trying to make a scandal there where there is none. And theyre doing it to go after Hillary Clinton, among others. Its my view that since they theyre creating this committee, we shouldnt stay away, we should be part of it. For no other reason than to point out how unfair it is.\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) echoed Waxmans position, saying that even a kangaroo court would be better off with a defense attorney and that its important for Democrats on the panel to step up and make sure Republicans on the panel arent badgering witnesses.\nPelosi eventually came around to their point of view, and appointed several Democrats who have investigated the attacks.\nIn an interview just moments before Pelosi announced him as the panels top Democrat, Cummings said while hes concerned about the attacks against Clinton, he has no hesitancy saying shell be able to deal with it.\nYeah its a concern because the Republicans will attack Hillary Clinton by any means necessary, Cummings said, sitting just outside the House chamber. But I think she can hold her own. And I think that the Clintons are so used to being attacked.\nNew York Rep. Eliot Engel said Democrats shouldnt allow the investigation to be made about one person.\nI think the American public feels that Hillary Clinton did an outstanding job as secretary of state and if Republicans are using Benghazi to blemish her record, I dont think it will stick, Engel said.\n\n",

One suspect was both a Boy Scout den leader and a Little League baseball coach.\nThe arrests also included High Bridge, N.J., mother Lori Bauer, 38, who was charged with producing and distributing pornography involving her own child.\nOfficials said the voluminous evidence seized suggests the sexual exploitation of children in the New York City area has hit epidemic proportions.\nThe disturbing images confiscated off computers, smartphones and thumb drives included children as young as 3 years old being sexually abused, officials said.\nMarcus Santos/New York Daily News Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent James Haynes (center) announces the arrest of 71 individuals as part of Operation Caireen, a sweeping investigation into the anonymous trading of child porn over the Internet. He was flanked by Queens District Attorney Richard Brown (second from left), Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan (third from left), Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson (second from right) and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance (far right).\nThese crimes are hideous. And reasonable people cannot fathom such depravity, James Hayes Jr., the head of the New York office of Homeland Security Investigations, said at a press conference Wednesday.\nWe discovered tens of thousands of images that were horrifying and depicted children in positions they should never be forced into.\nThe suspected perverts were rounded up in all five boroughs, including 17 in Brooklyn and 23 in Queens.\nThese are real children whose abuse and victimization has been videotaped for the entertainment of an unfortunately large population of twisted individuals, said Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson.\nJason DeCrow/AP Hard drives, computers and other electronic devices seized as part of Operation Caireen.\nQueens District Attorney Richard Brown added that each time an image is viewed, traded, printed or downloaded, the child in that image is being victimized again.\nOne suspect, Yuriy Eydelnant, 50, was accused of planting a hidden camera in the bathroom of his Staten Island home to secretly make numerous videos of a female relative disrobing starting when she was just 14.\nThis conduct disgusts all of us, said Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan.\nAuthorities were prompted to launched the crackdown following the Jan. 23 arrest of Brian Fanelli, the chief of the Mount Pleasant Police Department in Valhalla, Westchester County.\nMarcus Santos/New York Daily News Authorities probed peer-to-peer file sharing networks to catch some 71 alleged sickos involved in a child pornography ring. Several computers and mobile devices were used in the operation.\nLess than two months after Fanelli, 54, was busted on federal child pornography charges, Brooklyn rabbi Samuel Waldman, 52, an instructor of Judaic studies, was arrested and charged with possession of child porn.\nThe investigations of Fanelli and Waldman uncovered a nest of deviants who used computers to exchange videos and photos of children having sex or being molested by adults, officials said.\nOn April 4, authorities, led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York, launched Operation Caireen  named after the Celtic goddess and defender of children.\nAlmost immediately, law enforcement officers were stunned by number of individuals sharing disturbing images on nearly 150 distinct Internet protocol addresses linked the New York City area.\nMarcus Santos/New York Daily News Arrests were made throughout the greater New York City area, including Westechester County and parts of New Jersey.\nBy May 15, investigators served 87 search warrants, busted 70 men and one women, and seized nearly 600 computing devices. The devices contain an astonishing 175 terabytes of unsettling sexually explicit photos and videos of children.\nThe sheer volume of confirmed and suspected instances of individuals engaging in the sexual exploitation of children identified through Operation Caireen is shocking and the professional backgrounds of many of the defendants is troubling, Hayes said.\nWe can no longer assume that the only people who would stoop to prey on children are unemployed drifters.\nNYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said the suspects allegedly utilized the Internet to possess, distribute and promote horrific acts against defenseless victims.\nJason DeCrow/AP Authorities recovered hard drives and other devices containing a whopping 175 terabytes of unsettling sexually explicit photos and videos of children.\nAmong those caught in the sting was NYPD officer Yong Wu, 34, who was arrested April 28 at his Ozone Park, Queens home. Agents traced an Internet protocol address to Wus house that made images and movies of child pornography available for distribution, officials said.\nAlso busted was Jonathan Silber, 42, a Boy Scout den leader and Little League baseball coach from Suffern, Rockland County, who possessed a cache of child pornography he made available to like-minded miscreants, officials said.\nOthers collared included Aaron Young, 33, a paramedic from Queens; Eduardo Salcedo Urzola, 22, who was working as an au pair; and Kenneth Gardner, 59, a registered nurse at the Westchester County Medical Center.\nBrooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said arrests send an unequivocal message to those who engage in trading child pornography  if you exploit our children, and their abuse, you will be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\nRelated Stories\n",

VPC\nBy Brett Molina and Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY 9:28 p.m. EDT May 21, 2014\nA view of eBay headquarters in San Jose, Calif.\n(Photo: Ben Margot, AP)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE\nOnline marketplace eBay says it will urge users to change their passwords following a \"cyberattack\" on a database with encrypted passwords and non-financial data.\nThe database includes information such as customers' names, encrypted passwords, email and physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. As of the end of their first quarter, the company has 145 million active buyers.\n\"It's substantial,\" says Simon Eappariello, senior vice president of engineering at iBoss Network Security. \"If they're going to contact all of their users to change their passwords, that's a major breach in anyone's book. That's a lot of data.\"\nHackers: Experts dissect the eBay privacy breach\n\"This is the new normal,\" said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with Gartner, a technology research company based in Stamford, Conn.\n\"It's part of a trend where criminals are going after credentials,\" she said. \"We've seen a big rise in the use of stolen passwords at banks. The criminals are cycling through all these passwords they've stolen, trying to use them,\" she said.\nAt some point, \"it could become pretty ominous. All this data's getting stolenwe have to assume it's eventually going to be used,\" said Litan. \"The criminals are building big data stores with as much financial information as they can get. Who knows what they're doing with all of it?\nThe Dark Web: Untangling cybercrime\nIn a statement released Wednesday, eBay says it has not found evidence of unauthorized activity or access to financial information, based on \"extensive\" tests. The company says financial data was not affected, pointing out credit card information is encrypted and stored separately from this database.\n\"We know our customers trust us with their information, and we take seriously our commitment to maintaining a safe, secure and trusted global marketplace,\" a company statement said.\nEBay is encouraging people who used the same password on other sites to change those credentials as well.\nThe company says it has seen no proof of unauthorized access to PayPal, its online payment service. \"PayPal data is stored separately on a secure network, and all PayPal financial information is encrypted,\" says the company.\nThe criminal groups behind these massive data breaches are typically out of Eastern Europe, Litan said. \"They're very well organized. They've got black markets set up to sell this stolen merchandise. They distribute it around the world. And the data is sold a lot faster than it used to be.\"\nWhile eBay has downplayed the breach because it didn't include financial information, the loss of an unknown number of passwords has the potential to compromise all websites, not just eBay, security experts say. That's because many consumers use the same password on multiple sites.\n\"The attackers will quickly take over accounts across the web wherever a user reused their username and password on another site,\" said Michael Coates, director of product security at Shape Security in Mountain View, Calif.\nEBay also was using a more easily-cracked method for protecting the passwords it kept on file. There are two commonly used ways to secure passwords, encryption and hashing. EBay was using encryption, which is the more easily broken, said Coates.\n\"Encryption allows eBay, or anyone who access the decryption key, to decrypt and see your actual password. Password hashing allows eBay to check if the password you enter is correct or not, but doesn't allow eBay (or hackers) to get the plaintext of your actual password,\" he said.\nThe compromise, which happened between late February and early March, resulted from a cyberattack targeting a small group of employee log-in credentials. Emails will go out to users today to request changes to their passwords. The company says they will also employ additional security measures.\nForrester analyst Tyler Shields says it's concerning that it took eBay until earlier this month to uncover the breach. \"From late February and March to just about two weeks ago is a LOT of time for an attacker to be roaming around your network and systems.\"\nTrey Ford, security strategist with Rapid7, says attackers could use information taken from the database to pose as legitimate company representatives.\n\"Users should be wary of anyone contacting them claiming to be eBay or any other company for that matter,\" says Ford. \"Expect an uptick in phishing, do not click links in email, or discuss anything over the phone.\"\nThe eBay breach is the latest in a series of attacks targeting customer data. Earlier this month, Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel stepped down months after hackers swiped financial information on 40 million customers. In April, AOL confirmed its email service had been hacked, with users complaining their accounts were sending spam to contacts.\nEric Chiu, president and co-founder of security firm HyTrust, says this cyberattack is more proof high-profile breaches like eBay and Target are occurring more frequently. \"This is another wakeup call that organizations need to take an 'inside-out' approach to security and assume the bad guy is already on their network.\"\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gRgxSH\nUSA NOW\nEBay urges new passwords after massive breach | USA NOW\nMay 21, 2014\n",

As we have previously said, ZeniMax did not contribute to any Oculus technology.  Oculus will defend these claims vigorously.\"\n+1\n[UPDATE] Following the publication of this story, Oculus VR issued a statement regarding ZeniMax's lawsuit.\n\"The lawsuit filed by ZeniMax has no merit whatsoever. As we have previously said, ZeniMax did not contribute to any Oculus technology. Oculus will defend these claims vigorously.\"\nThe original story is below.\nEarlier this month, ZeniMax accused Oculus VR of stealing virtual reality technology that would later become popular headset Oculus Rift, which Facebook purchased for $2 billion just two months ago. Now, the Fallout and Elder Scrolls parent company has filed an official lawsuit against Oculus VR and 21-year-old founder Palmer Luckey.\nThe suit accuses Oculus VR of \"illegally misappropriating ZeniMax trade secrets relating to virtual reality technology, and infringing ZeniMax copyrights and trademarks.\" It also accuses Oculus VR of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition. The suit, some 55 pages in total, was filed today in U.S. District Court in Texas.\n\"Luckey has held himself out to the public as the visionary developer of virtual reality technology, when in fact the key technology Luckey used to establish Oculus was developed by ZeniMax\" -- ZeniMax\nZeniMax further claims that defendants Oculus VR and Luckey unlawfully exploited ZeniMax's intellectual property, including trade secrets, copyrighted computer code, and \"technical know-how\" related to virtual reality.\nLegendary game designer John Carmack is at the heart of the matter. He worked on virtual reality technology while employed at id Software, and ZeniMax claims that this technology, \"developed by ZeniMax after years of research and investment,\" should belong to them.\nThe suit goes on to say that defendants \"refused all requests\" from ZeniMax to compensate them and that they continue to use ZeniMax's intellectual property \"without authorization.\"\n\"Luckey has held himself out to the public as the visionary developer of virtual reality technology, when in fact the key technology Luckey used to establish Oculus was developed by ZeniMax,\" ZeniMax said in a statement.\nIn a statement earlier this month , Oculus VR said it is confident that it can prove that \"all of [ZeniMax's] claims are false.\" The company went on to say at the time that there is not a line of ZeniMax code or any of its technology in Oculus products and that Carmack did not take any intellectual property from ZeniMax. We have reached out to an Oculus VR representative for comment regarding ZeniMax's lawsuit.\n\"Intellectual property forms the foundation of our business,\" ZeniMax CEO Robert Altman said in a statement. \"We cannot ignore the unlawful exploitation of intellectual property that we develop and own, nor will we allow misappropriation and infringement to go unaddressed.\"\n\"ZeniMax and id Software take their intellectual property rights seriously,\" ZeniMax's legal counsel Anthony Sammi said in a statement. \"We now look to the federal courts and will pursue all appropriate measures available under the law to rectify defendants' egregious conduct.\"\nZeniMax is seeking unspecified damages and a trial by jury for the case. We will continue to monitor this story as it develops.\nEddie Makuch is a news editor at GameSpot, and you can follow him on Twitter @EddieMakuch\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

One in 10,000 college graduates clicking a banner ad.\nPart of growing up and becoming familiar with the internet, is learning how to put up blinders to the internet.\nSome advertisers have tried coercion  forcing you to watch a video before you can get to the content you actually want to see. Weve learned to ignore those too.\nWhat I end up doing is switching browser tabs, muting the ad  Ive seen so many friends do this  and coming back to it later, says Jeff Harmon, with Harmon Brothers Inc. He was behind one of the most famous ad campaigns of 2013 , for bathroom deodorizer Poo-Pourri.\nBut thats really clinging to the old TV mindset, says Harmon, which doesnt translate to the internet where ignoring annoyance is just a click away. Plus, many advertisers  Google among them  have been moving away from that kind of force-feeder advertising.\nThese days, most video ads, for example, make you sit through just 5 seconds of an ad. So if you like it, you can watch the rest, and if you dont, you move on.\nSo really, the strategy that will win in the future will be the strategy that wins today: Being relevant and engaging, says Harmon.\nPerhaps in the future, we will turn to our Google-refrigerators and iCoffee makers for content: hilarious ads, dramatic ads, or companionship, friendship, and love.

Facebook is following suit with a new optional mobile feature that will listen to whatever music, TV show, or movie that is playing nearby, and share a 30-second clip with your friends.\nBy Karis Hustad ,Staff Writer /       May 21, 2014\nFacebook is rolling out a new optional feature for status updates that recognizes the song you're listening to, or TV or movie you are watching.\nFacebook\nKaris Hustad\nStaff Writer\nKaris Hustad writes for the innovation and business desks at the Monitor, covering new ideas in technology, start-ups, and privacy, among other topics in the cyber world.\nRecent posts\nThe Christian Science Monitor\nWeekly Digital Edition\nThats the idea behind Facebooks newest technology, an optional feature that will listen to a snippet of whatever media youre consuming and share a 30-second preview of it on your timeline. Facebook says the technology, which was developed in-house though it mimics the functionality of music-recognition app Shazam, allows users to share information faster than before. This comes on the heels of several optional new features to the social media site that indicate Facebook is nudging its users to share in more ways than ever before.\nRECOMMENDED: How 17 famous tech companies got their names\nToday, were making [conversations] quicker and easier by introducing a new way to share and discover music, TV and movies, writes Aryeh Selekman, product manager at Facebook, in a blog post.\nWhen writing a status update  if you choose to turn the feature on  youll have the option to use your phones microphone to identify what song is playing or what show or movie is on TV, he continues. That means if you want to share that youre listening to your favorite Beyonc track or watching the season premiere of Game of Thrones, you can do it quickly and easily, without typing.\nHeres how it works. When you open the Facebook app on your mobile phone and go to create a status, youll see a small smiley face. Hit that and youll be able to enable or disable the feature. If you enable the feature, any time you go to create a status update, Facebook will automatically tune into your surroundings and listen for TV show or music audio to identify. Blue audio bars on the side of the status show what Facebook is picking up. Early tests of the service show that Facebook regularly can identify audio in less than 15 seconds, faster than many other music-recognition services.\nOnce it is on your status, friends can listen to a 30-second preview of the song on Spotify or watch a 30-second clip of a TV show or movie. This status update will show up in the same section as when you share feelings or activities alongside a typed message, such as drinking a coffee or feeling excited, a function Facebook says has been used more than 5 billion times.\nWhats the difference between this and just typing out, Watching: Game of Thrones  or Listening to: Miley Cyrus? Mr. Selekman told the Wall Street Journal it adds another interactive dimension, which in turn may motivate more sharing.\nWe want to help people tell better stories, he says. I hope there are people who love the feature and post more.\nBut with all of these applications, the trade off is sharing more data with a company that makes their money off targeted ads toward users based on data they have collected.\nRECOMMENDED: How 17 famous tech companies got their names\nThis move comes on the heels of several other initiatives that knit the digital and online world closer together on Facebook.\nOn Tuesday, Facebook released an Ask button that allows people to inquire about the relationship status of Facebook friends who have previously not divulged that information. It also released an \"I Voted\" button that will prompt users to share whether or not they voted in a regional election. Last month, Facebook rolled out an optional mobile feature called Nearby Friends that lets users see what friends are in a given radius based on GPS location.\nRelated stories\n",

Supernova discovery reveals clues.\nInstead of quietly collapsing into black holes, as some astronomers predicted, at least some Wolf-Rayet stars explode spectacularly, say astronomers.\nBy Charles Q. Choi , SPACE.com Contributor /       May 21, 2014\nA brilliant supernova (right) explodes in the galaxy UGC 9379, located about 360 million light-years from Earth, in this before-and-after view. The left image was taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, while the right image was obtained with a 60-inch telescope at the Palomar Observatory.\nAvishay Gal-Yam, Weizmann Institute of Science\nThe Christian Science Monitor\nWeekly Digital Edition\nThese findings shed light on the star explosions that provide the universe with the ingredients for planets and life, the researchers added.\nWith a mass more than 330,000 times that of Earth, the sun accounts for 99.86 percent of the solar system's total mass. But as stars go, the sun is a lightweight. The largest and most luminous stars in the universe are Wolf-Rayet stars, which are more than 20 times as massive as the sun and at least five times as hot. Only a few hundred of these titan stars are known to astronomers. [ Biggest Star Mysteries of All Time ]\nThe intense heat of Wolf-Rayet stars forces their matter apart, making them extraordinarily windy stars. They usually lose the mass equivalent to that of the Earth each year, blowing winds at up to 5.6 million mph (9 million km/h).\nRECOMMENDED: Are you scientifically literate? Take our quiz\nHow giant stars die\nAstronomers long suspected that Wolf-Rayet stars violently self-destructed as supernovas, the most powerful stellar explosions in the universe. These outbursts are bright enough to momentarily outshine their entire galaxies, and enrich galaxies with heavy elements that eventually become the building blocks for planets and life.\nHowever, the gigantic amounts of matter these stars blow out usually obscure them completely, so scientists weren't sure how they form, live and die.\n\"Finding what kind of star exploded, after it already exploded, is, of course, a hard problem, since the explosion destroys much of the information,\" said study author Avishay Gal-Yam, an astrophysicist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\nSome researchers even raised doubts as to whether Wolf-Rayet stars detonated as supernovas at all. \"Some modelers predict that massive Wolf-Rayet stars will collapse into a black hole 'quietly,' without making a luminous supernova,\" Gal-Yam told Space.com.\nNow, for the first time, scientists have direct confirmation that a Wolf-Rayet star died in a supernova. They detail their findings in the May 22 issue of the journal Nature.\nThe researchers focused on a supernova named SN 2013cu, which exploded about 360 million light-years away from Earthin the Bootes constellation. This explosion was a Type IIb supernova, meaning it took place after the core of its star ran out of fuel, collapsing into an extraordinarily dense nugget in a fraction of a second and rebounding with a blast outward. What is left over after such supernovas is either a neutron star or a black hole.\nA Wolf-Rayet smoking gun\nBy surveying the sky with the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), a project that charts the sky with a telescope mounted with a robotic observing system, the researchers discovered the supernova very soon after it happened.\n\"We now send high-quality supernova alerts to astronomers all around the globe in less than 40 minutes,\" said study co-author Peter Nugent, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe scientists next rallied ground- and space-based telescopes across the world to observe the infant supernova approximately 5.7 hours and 15 hours after it detonated.\n\"Newly developed observational capabilities now enable us to study exploding stars in ways we could only dream of before,\" Gal-Yam said. \"We are moving towards real-time studies of supernovae.\"\nThe explosion ionized surrounding molecules in an ultraviolet flash, giving them an electric charge. The ionized material that surrounded the star emits light that \"tells us the elemental composition of the wind, and hence the surface composition of the star as it was just before it exploded,\" Gal-Yam said. \"That is a very powerful clue about the nature of the exploding star and how it evolved before it exploded, and this is the first time we managed to get this information.\"\nThat opportunity lasts only for a day before the supernova blast wave sweeps the ionization away, Gal-Yam added.\nThis light suggested the precursor ofthe supernova was a nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet star . \"This is the smoking gun,\" Nugent said. \"For the first time, we can directly point to an observation and say that this type of Wolf-Rayet star leads to this kind of Type IIb supernova.\"\n\"When I identified the first example of a Type IIb supernova in 1987, I dreamed that someday we would have direct evidence of what kind of star exploded,\" said study co-author Alex Filippenko, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's refreshing that we can now say that Wolf-Rayet stars are responsible, at least in some cases.\"\nFuture studies could analyze more Wolf-Rayet stars, to see if these violent deaths are standard for them.\n\"If we can show that this is the norm for such massive stars, it would mean that new theories will have to be developed to explain how you can make a black hole and still throw out a lot of material and a lot of energy to make a luminous supernova,\" Gal-Yam said.\n",

Moroz/Mathew Citarella\nHis findings are published in this week's edition of the journal Nature .\nComb jellies, or ctenophores, look like tiny disco balls and propel themselves around oceans using specialized hairs, lapping up small prey with their sticky tentacles. They are aliens whove come to Earth, says Leonid Moroz, a neuroscientist at the University of Florida in St Augustine.\nThe genome of the Pacific sea gooseberry (Pleurobrachia bachei)...adds to the mystery of ctenophores. The sequence omits whole classes of genes found in all other animals, including genes normally involved in immunity, development and neural function. For that reason, the researchers contend that ctenophores evolved a nervous system independently.\nMore at Reuters :\nTraditional scientific reasoning has held that simple nerve nets evolved all the way up to a human level of complexity along a single path. But it now appears that comb jellies took a different route, using neurochemical language that does not exist in other animals.\n\"All other animals have the same chemical language and these guys have completely different language. It's not only different grammar. It's a different alphabet,\" Moroz said.\nYou can listen to a Nature podcast on the findings here .\nBoing Boing editor/partner and tech culture journalist Xeni Jardin hosts and produces Boing Boing's in-flight TV channel on Virgin America airlines (#10 on the dial), and writes about living with breast cancer.

Or, on a far sillier note, would you like your very own Grumpy Cat or Doge ?\nA new app aims to help you find a lookalike for your departed or dream pet by using photo-matching software to find the closest match in your area.\nPetMatch lets you upload a picture of a dog or cat, or use one from its gallery. It then tries to find you a pet available for adoption that is the closest possible match to the one you posted.\nThe app is from startup Superfish and uses its patented image-recognition technology. It scans your photo, registering details like the shape of an animal's mouth, the distance between its eyes, its coloring and its general size and shape.\nThis PetMatch search produced similar-looking cats to the one in the upper left.\nIt then performs a similar search on PetFinder , a database with photos of hundreds of thousands of animals up for adoption throughout the United States, and gives you the closest overall matches, as well as the closest ones in your area.\nOf course, it's not perfect. If the picture you upload shows an animal at an odd angle, is blurry or otherwise differs from typical shots by animal-rescue groups, there's no telling what it will return for you. (Tech-news site The Verge claims a photo of Lady Gaga produced a \"matching\" image of a hamster .)\nThe app also doesn't necessarily consider the breed of the animal you photograph, if that's something that's important to you.\nAnd, of course, we love our animals for reasons other than their appearance. Photos don't show personality. Or intelligence. Or, in special circumstances, megalomaniacal tendencies and palpable disdain for underlings .\nWe tested the app with a photo of Cash, a gray-and-white Scottish Fold cat in Atlanta, and it returned matches of cats with similar coloring in Jefferson, Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; Huntsville, Alabama; Charlotte, North Carolina, and other neighboring states.\nA few of the cats looked vaguely like Cash, although most did not. But the pool of available cats may grow larger as more pet shelters connect with the database.\nThe PetMatch app, released this month, is currently available only on Apple's iOS operating system.\nAnd while it will no doubt be helpful to pet seekers, PetMatch is not the only product the folks at Superfish have in mind. The company has been around since 2006 and its photo-recognition tool has been available as a standalone iOS app or a Web browser extension for a while.\nNow, it's planning to expand its item-specific offerings, with jewelry and furniture apps in the works.\n",

            "content": "By Robert Sanders , Media Relations | May 21, 2014\nBERKELEY \nDan Werthimer, who directs Berkeleys new SETI Research Center, summarized current efforts to search for extraterrestrial intelligence at a hearing today (Wednesday, May 21) of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\nAt the invitation of committee chairman Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Werthimer and astrobiologist Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., described current projects to find intelligent life on other planets and how NASAs Kepler space observatory is contributing to this effort. They also reviewed the newest projects, such as eavesdropping SETI, and the latest tools, including the Allen Telescope Array in northern California now operated by the SETI Institute.\nThe Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.\nSETI experiments are trying to determine whether other intelligent, technologically capable, life exists in the universe, Werthimer told the committee, to answer the question Are we alone? or Is anybody out there?\nHe noted that the Kepler mission has shown that the Milky Way Galaxy alone has a trillion planets, three times the number of stars.\nBillions of these planets are Earth sized and in the habitable or so called Goldilocks zone  not too distant from their host star (too cold), and not too close to their star (too hot). And there are billions of other galaxies outside our Milky Way galaxy  plenty of places where life could emerge and evolve, he added.\nI hope todays hearing will enable us to learn more about how research in astrobiology continues to expand this fascinating frontier, Smith said in his opening remarks. The unknown and unexplored areas of space spark human curiosity. Americans and others around the world look up at the stars and wonder if we are alone or is there life on other planets.\nLongest running SETI project\nUC Berkeley operates the longest-running search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as well as the popular crowd-sourced computing project SETI@home. Werthimers searches have piggybacked on the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, the worlds largest radio telescope. Since 1999, that data has been funneled into SETI@home, which allows volunteers to use their idle computer time to search for patterns in extraterrestrial radio signals that might be an indication of intelligent life.\nSearching for ET\nAbout ourselves\nhaiku by SETI@home volunteer Paula Cook\nIn a phone conversation from Washington, Werthimer noted that one limitation of merely scanning the sky for signals from ET is that, unless ET is deliberately attempting to signal other intelligent life, it relies on picking up signals accidentally leaked from other civilizations. Earth broadcasts of the TV series I Love Lucy have already reached the nearest stars, betraying our existence to any intelligent civilizations that may live there.\nBut many advanced societies would probably limit such wasted energy, he said, either sending signals via fiber or in tightly focused beams. If these civilizations have colonized other planets in their solar systems, however, they would still have to send signals between planets, or at least use broad beams to track spacecraft. Werthimer and his SETI colleagues have embarked on a new project called eavesdropping SETI, where they listen only when two planets in a distant system are aligned with Earth, giving Earth a chance to intercept such targeted communications.\nThe Kepler mission has given us a ton of multiplanet systems to look at, said Werthimers colleague Andrew Siemion, a research scientist at the Space Sciences Laboratory who holds joint postdoctoral appointments at ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, and Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands. In 2012, the team observed 75 such line-ups using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank telescope in West Virginia.\nThe Robert Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the largest steerable radio telescope in the world.\nThey now plan a broader, more coordinated effort, dubbed the Panchromatic SETI Project, to observe the planets around all 30 stars within 13 light years of Earth in the northern hemisphere. To do this, the UC Berkeley collaborators will harness six different ground-based telescopes, including Arecibo, Green Bank and the Keck telescopes in Hawaii, to look for optical, infrared and radio signals simultaneously and for more extended periods of time.\nWhile admitting that no confirmed exoplanet detections have been made around any of the stars in our sample, Siemion said that statistically speaking, we know that some of these stars should host habitable planets, and this survey will be the first to put broad multi-wavelength limits on how common technological civilizations are.\nWe plan to use every technology we have available to us to look very, very closely at these 30 stars, he said.\nWerthimer noted in his committee remarks that while SETI programs use the worlds largest radio and optical telescopes to search for evidence of advanced civilizations and their technology on distant extrasolar planets, two of the best  the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes  are in danger of losing federal funding.\nIts unfortunate that the two largest radio telescopes in the world and that are best for SETI are in danger of closing their doors, he said.\nClick here to download a PDF copy of Werthimers remarks.\nRELATED LINKS\n",

Officials have said 26 such facilities were now under investigation. [ID:nL1N0O702E]    The Veteran Affairs department oversees some 1,700 hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other facilities, making it the nation's largest healthcare organization.\n(Additional reporting by Mark Felsenthal and David Lawder; Editing by Jim Loney and Andre Grenon)\nFILED UNDER:\n",

Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania said Wednesday that he would not appeal a judge's ruling striking down the state's ban on same-sex marriage. With the decision, Pennsylvania became the 19th state, along with the District of Columbia, where same-sex couples are able to marry.\n2 Marriage ban: Four gay couples are suing Montana over its constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. That leaves North Dakota and South Dakota as the only two states with gay marriage bans and no lawsuits seeking to overturn them. The Montana lawsuit was being filed Wednesday in federal court in Great Falls, with help from the Montana ACLU . It lists as plaintiffs four Montana couples who are either unmarried or were married outside the state.\n3 Air passengers' rights: Passengers love the idea, but airlines hate it. The government wants to require that travelers be told up-front about basic services that aren't included in the price of a ticket and how much extra they'll cost. The Transportation Department proposed Wednesday that passengers be provided detailed information on fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, advance seat assignments and carry-on bags. The rules would apply whether passengers bought tickets on the phone, in person or online - and not just from airline websites. Airlines that want their tickets to remain available through travel agents and online ticketing services would have to provide them information on fees for basic services, too, something most have been reluctant to do.\n4 Bus crash: A bus rolling through a remote stretch of desert struck a load of metal pipes scattered across a dark California highway Wednesday, then slid down an embankment and overturned in an accident that killed four passengers and seriously injured at least seven others. Only a minute or two before the collision, the pipes had tumbled from a flatbed truck that jackknifed after drifting into the dirt median on Interstate 10, the main road linking Southern California and Arizona, the California Highway Patrol said. Wednesday's crash occurred around 2:15 a.m. just west of Blythe, near the Arizona border.\n5 California parks director: California's state parks director abruptly announced his retirement Wednesday, just 19 months after he took control of the department that had been rocked by years of fiscal mismanagement. Anthony Jackson , a retired Marine Corps major general, said in a statement that his tenure \"has been a challenging, but ultimately fulfilling\" one. Jackson took office in November 2012 after the previous director resigned following disclosures that the department kept $54 million hidden in two special funds for more than a decade, even as budget cuts threatened to close 70 of nearly 280 state parks.\n6 Arizona wildfires: Hundreds of firefighters poured into Arizona on Wednesday to battle a wind-whipped wildfire in a canyon near Sedona that sent up choking plumes of smoke and scuttled Memorial Day weekend plans in the popular hiking and camping area. Authorities warned about 3,200 residents between Sedona and Flagstaff that they need to be ready to evacuate if the fire makes another advance. The blaze earlier Wednesday doubled in size to 1 1/3 square miles and could grow by nightfall to 2,000 acres, or about 3 square miles.\n",

            "content": "New National Monument Sparks Border Concerns\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. May 22, 2014 (AP)\nBy SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN Associated Press\nPresident Barack Obama on Wednesday declared almost a half-million acres of rugged desert terrain along the U.S.-Mexico border as a national monument, marking the largest swath of land to be set aside for that purpose since he took office.\nWhile praised by environmentalists, the move is generating criticism from some lawmakers in the West and local law enforcement agents who see Obama's use of power as a threat to security in a region where the influence of Mexican drug cartels, human smuggling and illegal immigration are all apparent.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and others also complained that the designation of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in southern New Mexico is the latest example of Obama taking unilateral action to sidestep Congress.\n\"Once again, the president has chosen to bypass the legislative branch  and, in this case, do so in a manner that adds yet another challenge in our ongoing efforts to secure our southern border,\" Boehner said. \"At a time of continued cartel violence in Mexico, we should not be putting any additional restraints on efforts to protect our borders.\"\nOfficials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the designation will not limit their ability to perform the agency's mission along the border.\nThe campaign by environmentalists, hunters and tourism officials to gain wilderness protection for the Organ Mountains and Desert Peaks has dragged on for a decade, with numerous versions introduced by the state's delegation over the years.\nNew Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, both Democrats, had most recently proposed legislation to protect the region, which includes hunting areas and features rock outcroppings, petroglyphs, ancient lava flows and sites such as Billy the Kid's Outlaw Rock and Geronimo's Cave.\nAfter hosting a series of public meetings, the senators amended their proposal to include a buffer zone for law enforcement. With Wednesday's proclamation, critics say there are no provisions to allow for local law enforcement to patrol the area.\nDona Ana County Sheriff Todd Garrison recalled the times his deputies and federal agents were shot at as they pursued suspected drug smugglers through the area. He also talked about stolen cars that were used to ferry drugs through the desert and past border patrol checkpoints.\n\"If we have no ability to patrol that area, crime is going to increase. It will be akin to the Organ Pipe National Monument in Arizona. I wonder how many years it will be before we have to post signs that say 'Enter at your own risk,'\" Garrison said.\nU.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, was among those who sent letters to Obama asking him to refrain from establishing the monument. Bishop said letting the legislation work its way through Congress would have allowed for border security concerns to be addressed.\n\"His decision stands, and now we have to go back in and try and fix it. That is just a backward way of trying to have good government,\" Bishop said. \"Originally the Antiquities Act was used to try and preserve stuff. These recent presidents are abusing the process to make a political statement, not to save anything.\"\nObama vowed during Wednesday's signing ceremony to make more proclamations using his executive power under the Antiquities Act to protect federal lands.\nPage\n",

Cuomos running mate in his bid for re-election, has previously served in Congress and as Erie County clerk.John Hickey/Buffalo News\nBy Jerry Zremski | News Washington Bureau Chief | @JerryZremski | Google+ , Tom Precious | News Albany Bureau\non May 21, 2014 - 3:00 PM\n, updated May 21, 2014 at 4:59 PM\nThe career of Kathleen C. Hochul\nADVERTISEMENT\nKathleen C. Hochul, a former member of Congress and Erie County clerk with a reputation as a personable politician and strong campaigner, is Gov. Andrew M. Cuomos choice to run for lieutenant governor.\nHochul, 55, would replace Robert Duffy, the former mayor of Rochester, who opted not to seek a second term as lieutenant governor .\nThis should be another big boost for Buffalo, Cuomo said. This is a big deal to have a lieutenant governor from your town.\nAfter months of speculation, Cuomo this afternoon made his selection known via video to the delegates attending the convention here that Hochul will be running with him in the general election against Republican Rob Astorino and his running mate, Chemung County Sheriff Chris Moss.\nHochul spoke briefly on the video shown to convention delegates as she sat next to Cuomo after he introduced her. Already playing the role of a running mate, Hochul said Cuomo has brought progress to the state and especially Western New York.\nI dont want to want to be on the sidelines, she said of her bid to re-join government service. New York State is on the move, but our work is far from finished, she added.\nLong associated with mere ceremonial duties, the job of lieutenant governor took on renewed attention in New York when David Paterson was elevated from second-in-command to governor in 2008 following the resignation of Eliot Spitzer , who became embroiled in a prostitution scandal.\nCuomo noted that Hochul will be the first female lieutenant governor candidate for the Democrats in 35 years. The governors selection of a woman comes as many female lawmakers have been urging him to step up his lobbying at the Capitol with the state Senate to get passed a 10-point womens agenda, which includes expansion of abortion rights.\nThe lieutenant governor is an important position for the campaign but even more important for this great state. Kathy is a person who knows upstate New York, knows Western New York, knows the federal government, who has worked in the private sector and knows business, who knows New Yorks needs across the board, Cuomo said.\nIf Cuomo defeats Astorino in the November election, Hochul will assume whats reputed to be one of the toughest jobs in Albany.\nCuomo has frequently dispatched Duffy to the far ends of the state to appear at events and take on special projects, leaving Duffy exhausted. Confirming earlier this month that he will not seek a second term, Duffy complained of the leg and back pain he was suffering from many long drives across the state, and he said the job was taking time away from his family.\nHochul will almost certainly be an energetic presence if she becomes lieutenant governor. Dating back to her days as an undergraduate student at Syracuse, where she led a failed attempt to name the Carrier Dome over college football legend Ernie Davis, shes had a reputation as a hard worker whos adept at working with others to achieve her goals.\nDemocratic Party insiders for weeks have been dismissing the prospects of Hochul, with a number of them saying  almost in a chorus  that she could be too independent to serve as Cuomos lieutenant governor. Duffy, who recently said he would not run again, said he found the job physically painful  the hours in a state car driving around such a big state took a toll on his bad back  and kept him away from his family in the Rochester area for too many days each week.\nHochuls selection comes after Cuomo has spent much time in Western New York the past couple years. Hes put special attention toward the area through programs such as his Buffalo Billion plan, which would drive $1 billion in special economic development aid to a region he maintains has been ignored by the state for decades.\nFour years ago, Cuomo lost all eight Western New York counties in his successful run against Buffalo businessman Carl Paladino.\nHochuls name was among at least a dozen floated by either Democrats, analysts or reporters, but Cuomo, a political master at keeping secrets with his close inner circle of advisers, remained mum throughout the past weeks.\nOthers that Cuomo considered as a replacement for Duffy included Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown, Suffolk County Executive Steve Ballone and Onondaga County Executive Joanie Mahoney, a Republican.\nDuffy, the outgoing lieutenant governor, praised Cuomos selection of Hochul and said it bodes well for upstate. Had Cuomo gone with someone downstate, the Democrats would have certainly been blasted by Republicans for having an all-downstate ticket.\nAs a lifelong upstate [resident] and someone who has lobbied for upstate in my previous career as mayor, I know how important it is to get upstates needs in the forefront of Albany, Duffy told The Buffalo News at the partys convention in Melville. Having the next lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, coming from Western New York means a great deal because she understands the issues facing upstate, shes served in Congress, shes been in the business community, and shes been elected to local office in Erie County.\nCuomos choice of Hochul revives a political career that stalled when she lost her congressional re-election bid to former Erie County Executive Chris Collins, a Republican, in a newly redrawn and heavily Republican district in 2012.\nHochul  who is married to William Hochul, U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York  graduated from Syracuse University and then worked as a congressional aide and a lawyer. She later served as Erie County clerk, where she worked to streamline the offices services to make them more consumer-friendly.\nHochul quickly won a reputation in Washington as a hard-charging lawmaker with a penchant for attracting media coverage, but that did her only so much good when redistricting made her district more strongly Republican.\nAfter leaving the House in January 2013, Hochul took a position with M&T Bank, where she has been working to build relationships with local, state and federal officials.\nBefore her term in Congress, she served as Erie County clerk from 2007 to 2011. Before that, she worked on the staffs of former U.S. Rep. John J. LaFalce and former U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She earned a bachelors degree from Syracuse University and a law degree from Catholic University in Washington, D.C.\nJust minutes before The News learned Cuomo was selecting Hochul, Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples-Stokes, a Buffalo Democrat whom Cuomo tapped earlier in the afternoon to be his campaign co-chairwoman, said she had no idea who the governor was selecting to be his running mate.\nI do not. I could speculate like everyone else here, Peoples-Stokes said at the partys convention on Long Island.\n",

His lawyers will probably argue that he is too ill and frail to serve prison time. The ex-leader still faces a retrial on charges related to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the Tahrir Square uprising of 2011.\nMubarak and his sons  Gamal, whom he had tried to anoint as his successor, and Alaa, a business magnate  can appeal Wednesday's verdict. If the sentence is upheld, they will get credit for time served. Four codefendants were acquitted.\nIn the caged dock, Mubarak sat impassively in his wheelchair, wearing a suit and tie, his hair still dyed jet-black, as the judge sternly lectured him about embezzling public funds even as the country grappled with dire needs. His sons, who also face additional graft charges, were in white prison uniforms.\nEgyptians were initially transfixed by images of a once powerful leader brought into court in the two cases against him, at times so enfeebled that he was carried in on a stretcher. The shock value diminished as the legal proceedings dragged on for months, then years. Even so, an acquittal would probably have caused a wave of popular discontent.\nAuthorities are keeping a tight grip on public order in advance of the presidential election, including steps such as closing universities during the week of the vote. Sisi, who has been the country's de facto leader since President Mohamed Morsi was deposed in July, is expected to overwhelmingly win the vote Monday and Tuesday.\n",

By stressing sustainable security supported by sustainable development, the concept also provides a framework under which Asia can aspire to its revival based on economic prosperity, stability and cooperation, Qu said.\nIn his proposal, Xi said Asia should oppose beefing up a military alliance targeted at a third party, and any attempt to dominate regional security affairs or infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.\nSecurity problems in Asia should eventually be solved by Asians themselves who are able to achieve regional peace and stability through cooperation, he said.\nHe urged countries in the region to insist on resolving disputes through peaceful means and oppose the arbitrary use of force or threats.\nProvocations and escalation of tensions for selfish interests should also be opposed, he added.\nBesides traditional security threats, Asia has found it difficult to respond effectively to non-traditional security threats including terrorism, transnational crimes, environmental security, cyber security, energy and resource security and major natural disasters which are clearly on the rise.\nTo build an Asian security mansion that could stand the test of wind storms, Xi said, We need to focus on development, actively improve peoples lives and narrow down the wealth gap to cement the foundation of security.\nWe need to advance the process of common development and regional integration, foster sound interactions and synchronized progress of regional economic cooperation and security cooperation, and promote sustainable security through sustainable development, the president added.\nThe summit came six decades after the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was put forward by Asian countries and adopted as a guide to international relations, said Li Weijian, a researcher with Shanghai Institute for International Studies.\nAs an extension of the five principles, the new concept will not only provide significant guidance to promote peace and stability of Asia, but also add momentum to the rebalancing of the worlds economic and security dynamics, Li said.\nThe summit was attended by leaders and representatives from 47 countries or international organizations, the largest scale in CICAs 22-year history.\nHuang Renwei, deputy dean of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said the summit reached wide and concrete consensus instead of empty talks.\nProposed solutions to the regions most pressing issues have high feasibility, and, if implemented well, could drive the forum to an architecture with higher level, he said.\nCalling the CICA the largest and most representative regional security forum with the largest number of participants, Xi proposed to make the forum a security dialogue and cooperation platform that covers the whole of Asia.\nHe called for enhancing the capacity and institutional building of the CICA, improving functions of the CICA Secretariat, and establishing a mechanism within the forum for defense consultations among member states.\nXi expected closer regional exchanges and cooperation in anti-terrorism, business, tourism, environmental protection, culture and people-to-people exchanges.\nThe Chinese president proposed to put in place a non-governmental exchange network for CICA parties through holding CICA non-governmental forums and other means, to increase the conferences influence and promote regional security governance.\nHe also suggested strengthening the inclusiveness and openness of the CICA, and step up cooperation with other organizations in the region and expand dialogue and communication with other regions.\nXis comments were echoed by Russian President Vladmir Putin who called the CICA an effective mechanism to drive security cooperation in Asia.\nIt is highly expected that as China has taken over the CICA presidency for 2014 to 2016, the forum would further promote peace and cooperation as a balanced, equal and coordinated security construct that takes into consideration each countrys interests and concerns, he said.\nKazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev said expanding economic cooperation should top CICAs agenda.\nHe believes the Silk Road economic belt envisioned by Xi could boost infrastructure development, laying a sound foundation for security cooperation among nations along the route that overlaps with the ancient trade itinerary connecting the East and the West.\nMore in Foreign\nNew York arrests 70 for child porn\nMay 22, 2014\nNEW YORK: Two police officers, a rabbi and a Boy Scout leader are among 70 men and one woman ...\n",
